Cherokee Bundle: cherokee-guardian
----------------------------------

This command-line tool is a wrapper for the main Cherokee
executable. It is used as a safety net to invoke `cherokee` and to
ensure it is always functioning. It also plays an important role in
the link:other_goodies.html#zero-downtime[zero-downtime] mechanism
implemented to allow graceful restarts of the server.

This is the full information provided by the manpage.

*NAME*::
       cherokee-guardian - Cherokee web server safe invoker

*SYNOPSIS*::
       cherokee-guardian

*DESCRIPTION*::
Cherokee is an extremely  fast, flexible  and embeddable
web server. cherokee-guardian is the recommended way to invoke
cherokee. It will launch  Cherokee with any options specified
to it via the command line, and monitor it. In case Cherokee
ends abnormally, it will be immediately re-launched.
+
In future versions, cherokee-guardian will probably become the
main binary to invoke Cherokee.
