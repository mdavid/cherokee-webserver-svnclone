Handler: uWSGI
--------------

The `uwsgi handler` allows Cherokee to communicate with the uWSGI
server. The configuration parameters are exactly the same from the
link:modules_handlers_fcgi.html[FastCGI], so check that section of the
documentation if you want to set up this handler.

uWSGI is feature rich and developer friendly. The
(link:http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi[uWSGI]) protocol is derived
from SCGI.
