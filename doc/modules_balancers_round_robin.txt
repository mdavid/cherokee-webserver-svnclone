Balancer: Round Robin
---------------------

If multiple server entries are defined, the requests will be round-robinly
served by each of them.

The configurable parameters will vary depending on what has been
selected as information host. If it is set to *remote*, only a host
address will be required. If that is not the case then configurable
parameters will be:

* Host: Either a local or remote host and port.

* Interpreter: Defines the command line of the interpreter for this
  server. If you are using FastCGI or SCGI and are launching the
  services manually, this entry is not needed.

* Environment variables: When running in local host, you can set up
  environment variables to be used by whatever is serving your
  load-balanced requests.
