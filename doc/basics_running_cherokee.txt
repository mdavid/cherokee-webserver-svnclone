Running Cherokee
----------------

There are several ways you can run Cherokee:

. Automatic start: this makes use of the mechanism offered by your OS
  that should have been configured when Cherokee was installed. It
  will run making use of the link:dev_cherokee.conf.html[`cherokee.conf`]
  present in your system.

. Guardian wrapper: The
  link:bundle_cherokee-guardian.html[cherokee-guardian] program comes
  as a standard part of the Cherokee bundle. It is a security
  mechanism that ensures Cherokee's recovery in case of any system
  failure. This is what is actually launched when Cherokee is
  automatically started.

. Command line: Cherokee supports a series of parameters to launch it
  from the command line. Refer to the the appropriate documentation
  section about link:bundle_cherokee.html[`cherokee`] to see the complete
  list of optional arguments.

. Cherokee-Admin: The administrative web interface allows you to setup
  and launch Cherokee. This is probably where you want to start if you
  have just installed the web server. Launch the
  link:bundle_cherokee_admin.html[`cherokee-admin`] process and follow the
  link:config_walkthrough.html[Walktrhough] section of the documentation.
