Running Cherokee
----------------

There are several ways you can run Cherokee:

. Automatic start: this makes use of the mechanism offered by your OS
  that should have been configured when Cherokee was installed. It
  will run making use of the link:cherokee.conf.html[`cherokee.conf`]
  present in your system.

. Command line: Cherokee supports a series of parameters to launch it
  from the command line. Refer to the the appropriate documentation
  section about link:cherokee.html[`cherokee`] to see the complete
  list of optional arguments.
 
. Cherokee-Admin: The administrative web interface allows you to setup
  and launch Cherokee. This is probably where you want to start if you
  have just installed the web server. Launch the
  link:cherokee_admin.html[`cherokee-admin`] process and follow the
  link:walkthrough.html[Walktrhough] section of the documentation.
