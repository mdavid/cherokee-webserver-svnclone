Elphel Cameras:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are network cameras that can provide high-resolution at high
frame video rates, and the embedded software and FPGA bitstream are
stored in the camera flash memory and can be updated. The embedded
software and FPGA hardware algorithms are Free Software, and the
devices can be configured to run Cherokee.

For information on how to do this, refer to the
