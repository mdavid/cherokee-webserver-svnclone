Cookbook: Streaming Audio and Video
-----------------------------------

It's really easy to configure Cherokee so it streams audio and video
files instead of sending then as a regular file.

The first thing you have to ensure is that Cherokee has been compiled
with the required libraries. In this case, the FFMpeg library set is
required. Cherokee uses it to extract information of the media files.

demonstrate how easy it is to use the Streaming wizard.

To configure Cherokee to stream media files is trivial. The only thing
you will have to do is to choose the virtual server on which you want
to enable the streaming functionality, and then click on the `Add New`
button located at the top of the panel.

Once in there, the only thing left to do is finding the the Streaming
wizard under the `Tasks` category, and following the
instructions. Right after which the virtual server will be ready to
stream your media files, including MP3, OGG, OGV, MP4, etc.
