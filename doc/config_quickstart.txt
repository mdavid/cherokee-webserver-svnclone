Configuration Quickstart
------------------------

This section briefly describes the whole administration web interface
provided by link:bundle_cherokee-admin.html[cherokee-admin]. This is
the only recommended way of configuring Cherokee. If you are looking
for development information, you should refer to the apropriate
section, especially link:dev_cherokee.conf.html[cherokee.conf] file
specification.

We will first show a quick overview of the available options, followed
by a simple walkthrough. You can learn more about the options in their
specific documentation entries.

Overview
~~~~~~~~
* link:config_general.html[General]::
  There are a number of entries that specify the most significant
  configuration options such as the port - or ports - that the server
  will listen to, the default timeout, whether to support keep-alive
  connections and so on.

* link:config_virtual_servers.html[Virtual servers]::
  If you want your web server to work with more than one domain you
  will have to create link:config_virtual_servers.html[Virtual
  servers] other than the `default` one. Each one will have a
  completely independent configuration: paths, behavior, logging
  facilities, etc.

* link:config_encoding.html[Encoding]::
  The encoders allow to transform whatever information the server is
  sending as a response of a request, no matter what handler is
  generating it.

* link:config_icons.html[Icons]::
  Associate icon images with one or more file extensions. Used to
  offer directory listings.

* link:config_mime_types.html[Mime Types]::
  Manage MIME types.

* link:config_advanced.html[Advanced]::
  This is to configure the most complex parameters of the server and how
  it interacts with the operating system. If you are unsure about any of
  the options here, better not mingle with them. Default values should
  work just fine.
