Cookbook: Setting up Trac
-------------------------

This recipe will install link:http://trac.edgewall.org[Trac]: an
integrated SCM and Project Management solution that gets along very
well with Cherokee.

It is written in Python and can work with Cherokee either using HTTP
or SCGI protocols. The recipe will address the second scenario because
it is slighlty more complex. Should you wish to run it via HTTP,
Cherokee would only have to relay the requests to Trac acting as an
link:modules_handlers_proxy.html[HTTP reverse proxy] and no other
configuration would be needed on that end.

Trac
~~~~
The software requirements are Python-2.5, easy_install and
SQlite-3.3.4 or above.

On Debian based Linux distributions, just a couple of commands issued
as `root` would suffice to provide the requirements and install Trac.

.Quick install
----
apt-get install python-genshi python-setuptools python-pysqlite2
easy_install Trac
----

The next thing would be defining a project environment:

.Project creation
----
$ trac-admin /path/to/project initenv
----

Of course, the path should be changed to whatever suits your
needs. You will be prompted for more details.

If you want to configure authentication or simply need more details,
refer to the link:http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracInstall[Trac
installation instructions] on the official site.

Cherokee
~~~~~~~~
The configuration on Cherokee's side is quite simple. You will only
need to know that you can spawn Trac as an SCGI process.

.Command to launch Trac
-------
/usr/bin/tracd --single-env --daemonize --protocol=scgi /
--hostname=localhost --port=4433 /path/to/project
-------

You can either start it manually, or better yet, automatically by
letting Cherokee spawn the server whenever it is down.
The process is fairly simple.

First we will set up an link:config_info_sources.html[information
source] with a local interpreter.

.Trac information source
image::media/images/cookbook_trac_info.png[Information source]

.Information sources
`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Host           , Interpreter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
localhost:4433 , /usr/bin/tracd --single-env --daemonize --protocol=scgi \
                 --hostname=localhost --port=4433 /path/to/project/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the port was not reachable, the `interpreter` command would be
launched and the process would be reinstantiated.  Note that, in the
definition of the information source, you will have to manually launch
the `spawner` if you use a `Remote host` as `Information source`
instead of a `Local interpreter`.

After doing this, we will just have to create a new rule managed by
the SCGI handler to access Trac. It can be created in a new virtual
server, `trac.example.net` for instance, or as a `Directory` rule for
a specific path such as `/trac`.

.Rules
image::media/images/cookbook_trac_rules.png[Rules]

As you can see, we are opting for the first approach and will only
need two rules. The `default` will use the `SCGI handler` as detailed
above, associated to the previously created information source.

.SCGI handler

The second one will be there to serve the few static files needed to
correctly display the Trac interface. Just create it as `Directory`
type rule for `/chrome/common` and set it to the `Static files`
handler and with a `Document root` that points to the appropriate
files: `/usr/share/trac/htdocs/`

.Static files

By now, your Trac installation should be up and running. Try it out!
