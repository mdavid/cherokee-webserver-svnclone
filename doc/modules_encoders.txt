Modules: Encoders
------------------

Encoders are Cherokee modules that can be used as filters. The most
common usage is to compress information allowing you to save
bandwidth. You should do that whenever you can since hardware is
mostly inexpensive while bandwidth is not. Besides, the performance
penalization suffered due to the compression process is trivial.

Of course it doesn't make sense to apply a processor intensive filter
to content that can't take advantage of it (i.e., it doesn't make
sense to try to compress an already compressed file because there is
nothing to gain).

The encoders must be enabled or disabled in a per rule basis.

This is the list of currently provided encoders:

. link:modules_encoders_gzip.html[gzip]
. link:modules_encoders_deflate.html[deflate]

It is interesting to highlight that Cherokee also supports negative
encoding rules. This translates into rules that forbid an encoder to
be used. To prevent encoding files that are already compressed, a
pretty simple rule such as the following one could be included to
avoid the problem.

* Match: Extensions (jpg,zip,gz,rar,7z)
* Final: No
* Encoder: Gzip: Forbid
