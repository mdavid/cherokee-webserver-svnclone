Modules: Enconders
------------------

Encoders are Cherokee modules that can be used as filters. The most
common usage is to compress information allowing you to save
bandwidth. You should do that whenever you can since hardware is
mostly unexpensive while bandwidth is not. Besides, the performance
penalization suffered due to the compression process is trivial, and
if the content is cached you will only suffer it once.

Of course it doesn't make sense to apply a processor intensive filter
to content that can't take advantage of it (i.e., it doesn't make
sense to try to compressed an already compressed file because there is
nothing to gain).

You can specify the filetypes to have encoding allowed or denied, and
you can select the policy to apply to this encoding process.

. Deny by default
. Allow by default
. Deny, Allow
. Allow, Deny
