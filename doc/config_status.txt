This section allows you to monitor the web server. You need to enable
the `Information Collector` setting in the
link:config_general.html[General section] in order to render usage
graphics.

In case statistics are collected, link:other_graphs.html[usage graphs]
are displayed in this section.

You can check information relevant to the web server as a whole, or on
a per-virtual-server basis which can be enabled or disabled
individually.
