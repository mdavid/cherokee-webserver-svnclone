~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pam validator uses the *Pluggable Authentication Module* to validate the
username/password combination.

[[parameters]]

Compatibility

Requires a valid user and password system pair to access the protected
directory. It will be available for all local users, unless a
restriction list is provided.

[[notes]]
Notes
^^^^^

The PAM approach ensures a dynamic configuration for how the
authentication is performed. This dynamic configuration must be
specified. This means that a /etc/pam.d/cherokee file must define the
connection between Cherokee and the pluggable authentication modules
that perform the actual authentication tasks.

Cherokee's installation procedure already takes care of the creation
of such file (under /etc or whatever system configuration directory is
used in your platform of choice). If you consistently fail to use the
PAM validator, make sure that such configuration deffinitions are set.

.Sample: /etc/pam.d/cherokee
