Modules: Validators
-------------------

Validator modules are used to implement an authentication mechanism.
Those can be selected from the `Security` section of each rule you
have in your `virtual servers`.

Note this is not the `Security` section of your virtual domains. It is
the `Security` tab within each of the rules in your `Virtual
server`. Those are accessible from the `Behavior` section of every
configured virtual server.

Depending on the complexity of the mechanism you will have to provide
more or less information. Here is an example of a simple validator
interface:

in the link:cookbook.html[Cookbook] for more detailed examples.
