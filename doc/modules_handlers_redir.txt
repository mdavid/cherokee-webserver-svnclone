Handler: Redirection
--------------------

The main idea of a redirection is telling the web client to go to
another URL when the requested URL matches a rule. If you are looking
for connection forwarding, you should check the
link:modules_handlers_mirror.html[generic balancer] instead.


For example, if you have URLs like::
+
----
    http://example.com/inst/photogallery/viewphoto?photoid=1235
    http://example.com/inst/photogallery/viewcomments?photoid=1235
    http://example.com/inst/photogallery/admin?photoid=1235&method=delete
----

You probably would prefer URLs like::
+
----
    http://example.com/photo/1235
    http://example.com/photo/1235/cmts
    http://example.com/photo/1235/delete
----

[[parameters]]
Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

This directive uses PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) to make
the substitution.

* Type: [External | Internal]

  - *Internal*:
    The redirection will happen internally, hence the internal URL in
    which the address is translated will be invisible for the client.

  - *External*:
    It works in the same way as the previous one, but in this case, it
    will redirect the connection to the new resource.

* *Regular Expression* and *Substitution* are the matching request and
   the intended target of such petition.

[[vhosts]]
Virtual hosts and redirections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internal redirections, using the `internal` keyword, are limited to
work in the same virtual host. All the internal redirections will be
processed in the original virtual host, which makes a lot of sense in
terms of security.

In case you do need to redirect a resource to another virtual host
and/or domain, you will have to use an explicit redirection using the
`external` keyword.

[[rule_type]]
The influence of the rule type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any rule type can be used with the redirection handler: Directory,
Extensions, Regular Expression, etc. Only the case where the type is
*Regular Expression* will require some more extra information.
Because of Cherokee's design, modularity and inheritance is heavily
used throughout the code base. This one is a special case because the
regex entry of the redirection handler can be empty whenever the
matching rule used is a regular expression (because it is inherited by
it).

The logic behind this is that you can set up a regular expression to
match the rule, but once you're in the redirection handler you could
or could not be needing another matching to be performed. If not, the
original one (the one from the rule) will be enough. If you do, you
can specify a completely different expression to be matched. For
instance, you could match the rule taking just the beginning part of
the request as meaningful, and once you are into the handler you might
want to consider just the end of it before making the substitution.

[[examples]]
Examples
~~~~~~~~

This example will perform internal redirections:

`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Regular Expression   , Substitution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
__/(\d+)$__          , http://example.com/inst/photogallery/viewphoto?photoid=$1
__/(\d+)/cmts__      , http://example.com/viewcomments?photoid=$1
__/(\d+)/delete__    , http://example.com/inst/photogallery/admin?photoid=$1&method=delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Which would translate into the following redirections for the listed
matching requests:

`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Request               , Internal translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
__/photo/123__        , http://example.com/inst/photogallery/viewphoto?photoid=123
__/photo/213/cmts__   , http://example.com/viewcomments?photoid=213
__/photo/501/delete__ , http://example.com/inst/photogallery/admin?photoid=501&method=delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
