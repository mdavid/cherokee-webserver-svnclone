Handler: Generic Balancer
-------------------------

This is the generic handler that provides the specific balancing
strategy implemented by the balancer modules. Check the documentation
for link:modules_balancers.html[Balancers] for information about the
necessary parameters for any of these.

Other handlers provide balancing mechanisms. Those are the
link:modules_handlers_fcgi.html[FastCGI] and the
link:modules_handlers_scgi.html[SCGI] handler. If you are not using
any of those but want to distribute the load among several servers,
this is the handler you should be using.

Currently it supports connection forwarding and balancing, so you can
configure it to forward the connection to a series of intranet servers
for example. The generic balancer will forward the whole request,
totally preserving its integrity: same URL, same headers, same
eveything. If you would require a more complex behavior you should
probably be using the link:modules_handlers_proxy.html[Rreverse Proxy]
handler.
