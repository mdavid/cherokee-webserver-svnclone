Cookbook: Setting up Moodle
---------------------------

Running link:http://moodle.org/[Moodle] on Cherokee is easy to
do. Since Moodle has relatively high requirementes (1GB RAM is
recommended), it is actually a very good idea to run a high
performance web server and see how things simply start flying.

The only software requirements are a web server, MySQL and PHP with
several extensions. You can see the complete list of
link:http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle#Software[software
requirements] at Moodle's site. Don't worry about this point. The
installer will detail exactly what are the missing modules, soy you
can install whatever you need during that part of the process.

You will need PHP support correctly configured in Cherokee. The
default configuration already provides a valid PHP configuration for
Cherokee if you have php-cgi installed, but you can follow the
appropriate recipe about link:cookbook_php.html[setting up PHP] in
case you don't have it available for some reason.

Of course, you will need to download Moodle from the
link:http://download.moodle.org/[download site].

We will be using
link:http://download.moodle.org/download.php/stable19/moodle-weekly-19.tgz[moodle-weekly-19],
which was the recommended option at the time of writing.

Uncompress it to `/var/www/moodle` and remember changing ownership to
that of the user under which Cherokee will be running.

Setting up Cherokee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no special settings on Cherokee's part besides having a
working PHP configuration.

Simply set the `Document root` to `/var/www/moodle` and you are ready
to go. This is done within the `Basics` tab of the chosen `Virtual
Server`.

Setting up Moodle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First download and uncompress the distributed Moodle release into
`/var/www/moodle`, and create a database suitable for the installation.

Log in to MySQL:

----------------
mysql -u root -p
----------------

And create the database for Moodle. We will be using the name
'moodle', the user 'moodleuser' and the password 'moodlepassword', but
you should set up your own.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE DATABASE moodle DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON moodle.* TO moodleuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'moodlepassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON moodle.* TO moodleuser@localhost.localdomain IDENTIFIED BY 'moodlepassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will also have to create a directory for Moodle to save data in
it. It must be outside the web document tree.

-------------------------------------
mkdir /var/www/moodledata
chmod 0770 moodledata
chown www-data:www-data moodledata
-------------------------------------

Then point your web browser to `http://localhost` and follow the
instructions provided by the installer. You will only need to provide
the above mentioned database information and very little else.

.Installation paths

.Database settings

As mentioned before, checks will be performed to see if the needed PHP
modules are available. Make sure to have the ones you'll be needing.

.PHP requirements

This will get you through the whole installation process in around 20
little extra steps give or take. Just click on `continue` and you
should be fine. It will populate your database and get you through the
whole installation process.

.Moodle in action

Once you are done, don't forget to set up your
link:http://docs.moodle.org/en/Cron[cron tasks] and configure the
link:http://docs.moodle.org/en/Backup_settings[backup settings]. You
can find all the information to create new courses and everything else
there is to know in link:http://docs.moodle.org/[Moodle's
documentation].
