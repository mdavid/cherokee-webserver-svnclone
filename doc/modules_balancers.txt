Modules: Balancers
------------------

These Cherokee modules allow to balance the load among several
servers. Cherokee is completely modular, and thus a distinction must
be made clear.

Balancer modules only implement the balancing strategy. To actually
use one of these strategies you will need to select a
link:modules_handlers.html[handler] that makes use of balancers in the
link:bundle_cherokee-admin.html[cherokee-admin] interface. Besides
this, balancing strategies can be utilized both directly within first level
Cherokee handlers and as second level subsystems used by other first
level handlers. The link:modules_handlers_mirror.html[Generic
balancer] handler is an example of the former, while the latter would
be the case for the link:modules_handlers_fcgi.html[FastCGI] or
link:modules_handlers_scgi.html[SCGI] handlers that can offer load
balancing as well.

These handlers can be chosen within the
`Handler` tab of the link:config_virtual_servers_rule.html[Rule
Options] section.

Every balancing strategy is used to manage one or more
link:config_info_sources.html[information sources], so at least one
has to be added to the pool managed by the balancer. To do this,
simply choose among the available sources in the `Assign Info
Sources`.

This is the list of currently supported balancing strategies:

* link:modules_balancers_round_robin.html[Round Robin]

And these are the handlers that use balancing:

* link:modules_handlers_fcgi.html[FastCGI]
* link:modules_handlers_scgi.html[SCGI]
* link:modules_handlers_mirror.html[Generic balancer]
* link:modules_handlers_dbslayer.html[MySQL bridge]
