Most common production server errors with Cherokee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- *Page 500*

  The most common cause of an Internal Server Error within Cherokee is
  problem of invalid headers. If your cgi script for some reason does
  not send out a headerless (eq. Content-type: text/html) streams, you
  will hit this bug. Check scripts, error log etc. to find out what
  causes it.

- *Page 503*

  When an information source is unavailable, the server will return a
  503 for that request. Cherokee will constantly try to find a new
  information sources, but it will take (as most) the total amount of
  defined sources in request to find back a working information
  source. If a 503 stays present, you can safely assume Cherokee is
  unable to start an interpreter or connect to the remote host that
  has the information source defined.

- *Page 400*

  If you are repeatedly receiving a 400 error while uploading files to
  a PHP backend, it could very well be related to PHP being the one
  restricting uploads bigger than a certain size. Check the [PHP
  recipe] for more details on how to fix this.

- *CLI*: Can't bind() socket (port=80, UID=1000, GID=1000)

  Most likely Cherokee is unable to start because you are not
  root. And you want to bind the webserver to a privileged port (80).

- *CLI*: Can't bind() socket (port=80, UID=0, GID=0)

  When you are root and get this message. There is a running Cherokee
  instance. The most efficient way to get rid of it:
+
----
  killall -s KILL cherokee
  killall -s KILL cherokee-worker
----

Restarting
~~~~~~~~~~

- If you just want to restart the webserver, this will do:
+
----
  killall -s HUP cherokee
----
