General Configuration
---------------------

image::media/images/admin_general.png[General]


Binding
~~~~~~~
When the server is initiated it opens a port and starts listening to incoming 
requests. By default this is port 80 and it will use all the 
network interfaces of the machine, which is usually the desired behavior. 


IPv6 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The IPv6 configuration key brings the possibility of activating or deactivating 
the IPv6 support at the server. If Cherokee has been compiled with IPv6 
support (--with-ipv6), this configuration entry will be fully functional, 
otherwise it will be ignored.


Timeout
~~~~~~~
Sets the number of seconds that Cherokee will wait before closing the 
connection. 


KeepAlive
~~~~~~~~~
Enables the global keep-alive support for the client requests.
It increases the client performance by reusing a connection for more 
than one request. It should most probably be turned on.

Full                     , Cherokee/{cherokee_version} (UNIX) Ext/0.0 Ext2/0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Cherokee will use **Full**.


Execution User and Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The User directive configures which user the Cherokee daemon will normally 
run as. By default, Cherokee runs as root which is considered undesirable 
in all but the most trustful network configurations. 

The User directive used in conjunction with the Group directive instructs 
the daemon to switch to the specified user and group as quickly as 
possible after startup. 

There are two possible formats: using the user or group name, or using 
the system ID.
