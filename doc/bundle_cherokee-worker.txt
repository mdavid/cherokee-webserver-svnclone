Cherokee Bundle: cherokee-worker
--------------------------------

This is the main Cherokee program. It can be launched in several ways
as shown in the section link:basics_running_cherokee.txt[Running
Cherokee]. Unless specified otherwise, `cherokee-worker` will try to
run with the configuration present in your default
link:dev_cherokee.conf.html[cherokee.conf] file.

This is the full information provided by the manpage:
**********************************************************************
*NAME*::
       `cherokee-worker` - Cherokee Web Server internal worker

*SYNOPSIS*::
       `cherokee-worker` [options]

*DESCRIPTION*::
       `cherokee-worker`  is a part of Cherokee, an extremely fast, flexible and
       embeddable web server. This executable is meant to be invoked  only  by
       `cherokee`. Executing it directly is a discouraged practice.

*DEVELOPMENT*::
       This  binary implements the Cherokee Web Server functionality, although
       it misses a few security features implemented on the main executable,
       `cherokee`.
       Executing it alone could be only useful for debugging purposes.

**********************************************************************

The accepted parameters are those of the
link:bundle_cherokee.html[cherokee] binary.

To illustrate the usefulness of such options take the following
example:

----
$ cherokee-worker -p 8080 -r `pwd`
----

Since both absolute and relative paths are accepted, it is equivalent to:

----
$ cherokee-worker -p 8080 -r .
----

This would allow any non-privileged user to statically share the
contents of the current directory. It's a great way to share files in a
local network whenever you are in a hurry. Remember that in Unix
systems only processes launched by the superuser have privileges to
be hooked to the lower 1024 ports of the system.
