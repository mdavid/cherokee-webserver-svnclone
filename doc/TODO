Improving the quality of Cherokee's documentation
-------------------------------------------------

Needs:
----------
  [1] Improve the navigability of the documentation.
  [2] Define a convenient hierarchical structure, generate a TOC, etc. 
      Currently the structure reflects more the internal architecture of 
      Cherokee rather than a traditional manual.
* [3] Integrate the current docs into the new tree.
* [4] Define and document a series of typical configuration tasks.

Tasks to be documented:
-------------------------------------
* <1> How to configure virtual hosts from beginning to end, step by step.
* <2> How to tune scalability (IO cache & file, number of threads, increment 
      descriptors...)
* <3> How to setup authenticated resources
* <4> How to configure the most spread apps servers (php, django, RoR,..)
* <5> How to manage logs  (make specific mention of usage of Cherokee-Tweak).
* <6> How to manage security (SSL/TLS, certs, etc)
* <7> Development documentation would be nice to have, Stefan de Konink 
      suggested example handlers *fully* documented and documenting the API, 
      though this last thing might be slightly out of the normal user 
      documentations scope. A Development section could be introduced when we
      design the new general draft.
* <8> Reference table of functionalities to be achieved (and hopefully
      a full setup example).
* <9> Cherokee on exotic devices
