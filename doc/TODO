Improving the quality of Cherokee's documentation
-------------------------------------------------

Needs:
----------
  [1] Improve the navigability of the documentation.
  [2] Define a convenient hierarchical structure, generate a TOC, etc.
      Currently the structure reflects more the internal architecture of
      Cherokee rather than a traditional manual.
  [3] Integrate the current docs into the new tree.
  [4] Define and document a series of typical configuration tasks.

Tasks to be documented:
-------------------------------------
  <1> How to configure virtual hosts from beginning to end, step by step.
* <2> How to tune scalability (IO cache & file, number of threads,
   increase descriptors, X-Sendfile...)
* <3> How to setup authenticated resources
* <4> How to configure the most spread apps servers (php, django, RoR,..)
* <5> How to manage logs  (make specific mention of usage of
   Cherokee-Tweak and log backers).
* <6> How to manage security (SSL/TLS, certs, etc)
* <7> Development documentation
* <8> Reference table of functionalities to be achieved (and hopefully
      a full setup example).
* <9> Cherokee on exotic devices
