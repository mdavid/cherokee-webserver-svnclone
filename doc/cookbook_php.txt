Cookbook: Setting up PHP
------------------------

There is not much to learn to configure PHP with Cherokee.
The default configuration (the one created by `cherokee-admin` from
scratch when there is no `cherokee.conf` present) already supports
PHP.

This example shows a typical usage of FastCGI. It connects to a
FastCGI server located in localhost in port 1234. If no server is
running, the webserver will run the FastCGI server by issuing the command
defined as the *Interpreter* sub-parameter:

This other example shows a typical usage of multiple FastCGI
servers. It connects to FastCGI servers in several locations. If no
server is running in the local computer, the webserver will run the
FastCGI server by issuing the specified command. Note that for remote
FastCGI servers, you are responsible to run the FastCGI services there
manually:

The **PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN** environment variable is mandatory for PHP
FastCGI servers.  It defines how much children should serve the
requests coming from the webserver.

If you define **PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS**, the value must be negative if
you do not want the PHP process to ever be restarted. If you leave it
unset, PHP will take the default value (500), after which it will be
restarted. It is generally a good idea to let PHP be restarted to free
up resources and possible memory leaks.


Note that only FastCGI-enabled binaries of PHP will work with the
FastCGI handler. Many prepackaged versions already enable this by
default. If yours does not, you will need to build a suitable
binary. You can check this with the `-v` parameter:

----
$ php-cgi -v
PHP 5.2.5 (cgi-fcgi) (built: Apr 20 2008 17:11:05)
Copyright (c) 1997-2007 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2007 Zend Technologies
----

You cannot proceed unless the *"cgi-fcgi"* string is present.
