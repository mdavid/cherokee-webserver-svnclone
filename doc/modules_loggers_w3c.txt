Logger: W3C
~~~~~~~~~~~

This logger produces logfiles conformant to the World Wide Web
Consortium standard. This standard defines lines that may contain
either a directive or an entry.

. Entries contain fields relating to a single HTTP transaction,
separated by white spaces. Unused  fields in any particular entry will
simply be replace by hyphens ("-").
. Directives register information about the logging process. If a line
starts with the '#' character, it contains a directive. The ones of
interest for Cherokee are:
+
----
Version: <integer>.<integer>::
 The version of the extended log file format used (1.0 in our case).
Date:<date> <time>::
 The date and time at which the entry was added.
Fields: [<specifier>...]::
 lists a sequence of field identifiers specifying the information recorded in each entry.

An example of log file in this format is this:

#Date: 11-Aug-2008 17:17:58
#Fields: time cs-method cs-uri
17:17:58 GET /index.html
