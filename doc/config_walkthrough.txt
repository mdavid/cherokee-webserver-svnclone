General configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number a link:general.html[general configuration] entries that specify the
most significant configuration options such as the port - or ports -
that the server will listen to, the default timeout, whether to
support keep-alive connections and so on.

Virtual Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want your web server to work with more than one link:vserver.html[virtual server] 
you will have just to create them. Each more will have a
complete independent configuration: paths, behavior, logging
facilities, etc.

Encoders
~~~~~~~~

The encoders allow to transform whatever information the server 
is sending as a response of a request, no matter what handler 
is generating it. 

    - link:modules_encoders_gzip.html[gzip] - GZip compression
    
      Encodes the output with GZip

Icons
~~~~~

The link:config_icons.html[Icons] configuration associates an icon
image with one or more file extensions. This information will be used
mainly by the link:modules_handlers_dirlist.html[dirlist] handler.


Advanced topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an link:advanced.html[advanced section] that allows to
configure the most complex parameters of the server and how it works
with the operating system.

If you are unsure about any of the options presented within the
advanced section, we recommend you to not change it and use the
default value.

Internal configuration system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administration interface is highly recommended, and is in fact the
only administration mechanism that should be used to configure
Cherokee. However, there is another way in which Cherokee developers
and very advance users can modify the configuration.

The link:internal_configuration.html[internal configuration system] text file format is documented so
