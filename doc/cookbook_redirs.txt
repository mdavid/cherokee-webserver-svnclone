Cookbook: Redirections
----------------------

Every now and then a redirection example is requested in the
link:other_community.html[mailing list]. This recipe is meant to be a
central archive of such examples. Remember there are some more generic
examples both in the link:config_quickstart.html[quickstart] and in
the link:modules_handlers_redir.html[redirection] handler sections.

There is also a wizard to automatically assist you with
redirections. It can be found in the `Wizards` link of the `Virtual
Servers` tab, under the `Tasks` category.

Redirecting www.example.net to example.net
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a site will have several domains or subdomains pointing to
the same official name. For whatever reasons (site statistics, for
instance), having many subdomains redirected to a unique subdomain
might be desireable. This can be accomplished farily easily. The
general recipe consists in defining a virtual host with the sole
purpose of redirecting petitions to the official subdomain. In our
example, this could manage __*.example.net__ and the __.com__ and
__.org__ variations.

The official name would then be managed by another virtual host
(just for __example.net__). The `redir` virtual host will have a
`Default` managed by the `Redirection` handler.

This in turn would define an _external redirection_ with a _Regular
Expression_ like __^/(.*)$__ and the apropriate _Substitution_:
http://example.net/$1

Keep in mind the redirection has to be external in order for Cherokee
to rewrite the the URL. If it wasn't, the redirection would be applied
but no change would be displayed to the users while browsing the site.
