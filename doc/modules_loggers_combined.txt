Logger: Combined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This logger produces logfiles that conform to the _Combined Log
Format_. It is commonly used by many programs, being the standard
format used by Apache. This is a *de facto standard* and is the most
widely used. As such, you are encouraged to use it.


This format is exactly the same as the
link:modules_loggers_ncsa.html[Common Log Format], with two extra
fields.

----
host rfc931 username date:time request statuscode bytes referer user_agent
----

Here is an example:

****
::ffff:127.0.0.1 - - [11/Aug/2008:16:17:58 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 2633 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; es-ES; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008072820 Firefox/3.0.1"
****

The description of the additional fields follows.
Refer to the link:modules_loggers_ncsa.html[Common Log
Format] documentation for information about the rest of the fields.


*referer* ("-") ::
This is the "Referer" HTTP request header. This indicates the URL
which linked the user to your site (as reported by the client). In
this case it is empty because no Referer exists (i.e. it is a direct
hit).


*user_agent* ("Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; es-ES; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008072820 Firefox/3.0.1") ::
The User-Agent HTTP request header. This is the information reported
by the client about itself.
