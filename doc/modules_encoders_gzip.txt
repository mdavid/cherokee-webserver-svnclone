Enconder: Gzip
--------------

This is a compression encoder used to reduce the outgoing bandwidth consumed
by the server and speed up things for the client.

Once again, the encoding support is based on modules, so if the configuration
file tells the server to load a module, it will get it ready to use, otherwise
there won't be any kind of support in memory.


For example, let's see how it works when the encoder is configured to
handle html files.

----
$ wget -q -O - http://localhost/example.html
----

It works!

----
$ wget -q -O - --header="Accept-encoding: gzip"  \
  http://localhost/example.html | gzip -dc -
----

It works!
