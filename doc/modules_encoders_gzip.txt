Enconder: Gzip
--------------

This is a compression encoder used to reduce the outgoing bandwidth consumed
by the server and speed up things for the client.

Once again, the encoding support is based on modules, so if the configuration
file tells the server to load a module, it will get it ready to use, otherwise
there won't be any kind of support in memory.

It's possible to specify which files can be encoded and which ones cannot.

With the previous configuration, it works as follows:
----
$ wget -q -O - http://localhost/example.html
----

It works!

----
$ wget -q -O - --header="Accept-encoding: gzip"  \
  http://localhost/example.html | gzip -dc -
----

It works!
