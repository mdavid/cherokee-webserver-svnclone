Enconder: Gzip
--------------

This is a compressiong encoder used to reduce the outgoing bandwidth consumed 
by the server and speed up things for the client.

Once again, the encoding support is based on modules, so if the configuration 
file tell the server to load a module, it will get it ready to use, otherwise 
there won't be any kind of support on memory.

It's possible to specify which file can be encoded and which ones are not.

With the previous configuration, it works as follows:
----
$ wget -q -O - http://localhost/example.html
----

It works!

----
$ wget -q -O - --header="Accept-encoding: gzip"  \
  http://localhost/example.html | gzip -dc - 
----

It works!
