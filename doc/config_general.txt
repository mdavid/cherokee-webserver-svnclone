General Configuration
---------------------

image::media/images/admin_general.png[General]


Networking
~~~~~~~~~~

Binding:
^^^^^^^
When the server is initiated it opens a port and starts listening to
incoming requests. By default this is port 80 and it will use all the
network interfaces of the machine, which is usually the desired
behavior. The *Port TLS* specifies the port to be used for secure
connections.


IPv6 support
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The IPv6 configuration key brings the possibility of activating or
deactivating the IPv6 support at the server. If Cherokee has been
compiled with IPv6 support (--with-ipv6), this configuration entry
will be fully functional, otherwise it will be ignored.


Listen
^^^^^^
This specifies the IP of the network interface to use. It can be left
empty.


Basic Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timeout
^^^^^^^
Sets the number of seconds that Cherokee will wait before closing the
connection.


Server Tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This specifies the string that Cherokee should use to identify
itself.

``~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Parameters               , Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Product                  , Cherokee
Minor                    , Cherokee/0.9
Minimal                  , Cherokee/0.9.0
OS                       , Cherokee/0.9.0 (UNIX)
Full                     , Cherokee/0.9.0 b1234 (UNIX)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Cherokee will use *Full*.



Server Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User & Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The User directive configures which user the Cherokee daemon will
normally run as. By default, Cherokee runs as root which is considered
undesirable in all but the most trustful network configurations.

The User directive used in conjunction with the Group directive
instructs the daemon to switch to the specified user and group as
quickly as possible after startup.

There are two possible formats: using the user or group name, or using
the system ID.

Chroot
^^^^^^

Cherokee can be jailed inside a directory. Note that this should not
be used as the sole security measure.
