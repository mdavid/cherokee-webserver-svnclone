General Configuration
---------------------

[[networking]]
Network
~~~~~~~

image::media/images/admin_general_networking.png[General]


IPv6 support
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The IPv6 configuration key brings the possibility of activating or
deactivating the IPv6 support at the server. If Cherokee has been
compiled with IPv6 support (--with-ipv6), this configuration entry
will be fully functional, otherwise it will be ignored.


SSL/TLS Back-end
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies the TLS/SSL backend to be used, if any. The current option
is OpenSSL.


Timeout
^^^^^^^
Sets the number of seconds that Cherokee will wait before closing the
connection.


Server Tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This specifies the string that Cherokee should use to identify
itself.

[options="header"]
|=======================================================
|Parameters |Description
|Product    |Cherokee
|Minor      |Cherokee/0.98
|Minimal    |Cherokee/0.98.3
|OS         |Cherokee/0.98.3 (UNIX)
|Full       |Cherokee/0.98.3 b2955 (UNIX)
|=======================================================

By default, Cherokee will use *Full*.

Graphs type
^^^^^^^^^^^
Through this you can enable or disable the usage of RRD graphs. Check
the link:other_graphs.html[usage graphs] section for more details.

[[ports_to_listen]]
Ports to listen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image::media/images/admin_general_ports.png[Ports to listen]

This section allows to configure the ports that the server will be
listening to. You can add several different ports, and configure
whether they will be used for HTTP or HTTPS.

Each binding entry can be configured to listen to a network
interface. In case the text entry is empty, the server will accept
connection from the port on any interface.

[[server_permissions]]
Server Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image::media/images/admin_general_permissions.png[Server Permissions]

User & Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The User directive configures which user the Cherokee daemon will
normally run as. By default, Cherokee runs as root which is considered
undesirable in all but the most trustful network configurations.

The User directive used in conjunction with the Group directive
instructs the daemon to switch to the specified user and group as
quickly as possible after startup.

There are two possible formats: using the user or group name, or using
the system ID.

Chroot
^^^^^^

Cherokee can be jailed inside a directory. Note that this should not
be used as the sole security measure.


[[icons]]
Icon management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The icons configuration file associates an icon image with one or more
file extensions. This information will be used mainly by the
link:modules_handlers_dirlist.html[dirlist] handler.


* **Extensions**

    - This allows to associate icons with extensions.

* **Files**

   - This section lets you specify an icon for certain filenames such
     as "core" or "README". It accepts wild-card strings (using * and
     ?)

* **Special icons**

    - **Directory**: In this case, it specifies the icon to be used
        with Directories.

    - **ParentDirectory**: This entry is used to assign an Icon to the
        "go to the parent directory" action.

    - **Default**: This is the icon that will be shown if any of the
        previous ones matched.

[[mime]]
MIME Types
~~~~~~~~~~
This section allows to add support for new MIME types or edit the
existing ones.

* *Mime Type*: this is the proper mime string.

* *Extensions*: the file extensions for this type of contents.

* *Max Age*: defines for how long a file of this type must be cached at
  the client's side.
