Configuration Wizards
---------------------

A whole lot of effort has been invested in making Cherokee as painless
to configure as possible. To this extent, its nifty configuration
interface is shipped with a bunch of configuration assistants.

These will help you to set up Cherokee to work with several popular
applications, frameworks and programming languages, and hopefully your
task will be performed with just a couple of clicks.

Even if they might not apply exactly to your what you are trying to
accomplish, they can always be used as a template that you can fine
tune afterwards.

Some of the wizards can only be applied to new virtual servers, others
can only be used inside pre-existent ones. Most of them, however, are
good for both scenarios.

Using them is as simple as clicking on the `Wizards` button located
under the list of `Virtual servers` or `Behavior rules`. The former
applies to new dedicated virtual servers, and is located on its
homonymous tab of the main interface. The latter is found on a tab by
the same name that exists for every virtual server defined on your
configuration.

Most of the wizards are documented on their corresponding recipes in
the link:cookbook.html[Cookbook].

The wizards are loosly organized on several categories: CMS,
platforms, tasks, misc, etc. Take a look at them. You might find
something interesting in the place least expected.
