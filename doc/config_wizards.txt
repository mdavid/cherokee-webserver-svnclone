Configuration Wizards
---------------------

A whole lot of effort has been invested in making Cherokee as painless
to configure as possible. To this extent, its nifty configuration
interface is shipped with a bunch of configuration assistants.

These will help you to set up Cherokee to work with several popular
applications, frameworks and programming languages, and hopefully your
task will be performed with just a couple of clicks.

Even if they might not apply exactly to what you are trying to
accomplish, they can always be used as a template that you can fine
tune afterwards.

Some of the wizards can only be applied to new virtual servers, others
can only be used inside pre-existent ones. Most of them, however, are
good for both scenarios.

Using them is as simple as clicking on `Add New` button located in the
upper part of the left panel, on the `vServers` section of the
admin. It is one of the two buttons available, and is marked with a
*+* (plus) symbol. This panel can change from `Virtual Server` mode to
`Behavior` mode, depending on it being applied to all the virtual
servers or to a specific one. In the former scenario the wizards will
create a new customized virtual host upon successful execution. The
latter scenario will have the wizards modify an existing pre-selected
virtual host.

Changing the way in which the wizards should behave is as simple as
toggling the panel in and out of `Virtual Servers` or `Behavior` modes. To
go to `Behavior` mode, select a virtual server and click on the `Rule
Management` button of the `Behavior` tab. To go to `Virtual Servers`
mode, simply click on the link for the virtual server that is
displayed in the upper section of the main content area. If there is
no such link, the panel is already in `Virtual Server` mode.

Most of the wizards are documented on their corresponding recipes in
the link:cookbook.html[Cookbook].

The wizards are loosely organized on several categories: CMS,
platforms, tasks, misc, etc. Take a look at them. You might find
something interesting in the least expected place.
