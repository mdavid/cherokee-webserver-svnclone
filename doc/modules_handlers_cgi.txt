Handler: CGI
------------

The cgi handler executes CGI programs.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

This module accepts three parameters:

[grid="rows"]
`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Parameters            , Type           , Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Script Alias          , String  , It defines a kind of execution interpreter. \
                                  The CGI will be run as a parameter of this \
                                  script.
Change to UID         , String  , Executes each CGI under its owner's user ID.
Error handler         , Boolean , Use CGI output as error message.
Check file            , Boolean , Check file existence to build PATH_INFO.
Pass request          , Boolean , Pass request headers.
Allow X-Sendfile      , Boolean , Use the non-standard X-Sendfile header.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the link:other_goodies.html#x-sendfile[X-Sendfile] feature
also supports `X-Accel-Redirect` headers transparently. This is to
allow the migration of applications supporting it whithout having to
make major code rewrites.

Warning:
~~~~~~~~

The `Check file` flag affects how PATH_INFO is generated. You should
disable this when you have an application that is running the whole
virtual server tree, as it is a common source of problems. You can
look at a practical example about PATH_INFO in the
link:modules_handlers_common.html[File & Send] handler documentation.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

This is a pretty common example. It defines a directory called `cgi`
which points to a path out of the Sever root directory where the
CGI programs are located.
