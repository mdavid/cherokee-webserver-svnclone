Handler: CGI
------------

The cgi handler executes CGI programs.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

This module accepts three parameters:

[grid="rows"]
`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Parameters            , Type           , Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Script Alias          , String  , It defines a kind of execution interpreter. \
                                  The CGI will be run as a parameter of this \
                                  script.
Change to UID         , String  , Executes each CGI under its owner's user ID.
Error handler         , Boolean , Use CGI output as error message.
Check file            , Boolean , Check file existence to build PATH_INFO.
Pass request          , Boolean , Pass request headers.
Allow X-Sendfile      , Boolean , Use the non-standard X-Sendfile header.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the link:other_goodies.html#x-sendfile[X-Sendfile] feature
also supports `X-Accel-Redirect` headers transparently. This is to
allow the migration of applications supporting it whithout having to
make major code rewrites.

Warning:
~~~~~~~~

The `Check file` flag affects how PATH_INFO is generated. You should
disable this when you have an application that is running the whole
virtual server tree, as it is a common source of problems. You can
look at a practical example about PATH_INFO in the
link:modules_handlers_common.html[File & Send] handler documentation.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

This is a pretty common example. It defines a directory called `cgi`
that points to a path out of the Sever root directory where the
CGI programs are located.

Environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When working with CGI and redirections, sometimes it is convenient to
have some persistent information between the CGI invocations. This is
the case when an error has to be redirected to a error-handling page.

To ease up accessing such values, some server environment variables are
set by Cherokee. The complete list of environment variables added
follows:

This info will be added upon completion of issue 40

* REDIRECT_URL: the URL-path that was not found. For example, if a
  missing page -`http://example.net/nonexistent.htm`- was requested,
  this variable would be set to `/nonexistent.html`.

* REDIRECT_STATUS: the HTTP response obtained from the original
  request. This is `404`.

* REDIRECT_REQUEST_METHOD: the method of the original request, such as
  GET or POST.

* REDIRECT_ERROR_NOTES: a brief description of what went wrong, for
  example, "File does not exist: /usr/local/docroot/nonexistent.html".

* SERVER_ADDR: This will typically be `::1` which is a unicast
  localhost address. This means that the packets sent to this addrress
  will be looped back on the same virtual interface.

* SERVER_PORT: Port to which the request was performed origianlly.

* REMOTE_PORT: Port to which the request was served.
