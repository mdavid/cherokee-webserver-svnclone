Icons
=====

The icons configuration file associates a icon image with one or more
file extensions. This information will be used mainly by the dirlist handler.

There are five sections on this file:


* **Files**

   * This section lets you specify an icon for certains filenames such as "core" or "README". 
     It accepts wild-card strings (using * and ?)

.. image:: media/images/admin_icons3.png
   :alt: Icons
   :align: center


* **Extensions**

    * In the same way, it allows to associate icons with extensions

.. image:: media/images/admin_icons1.png
   :alt: Icons
   :align: center


* **Special icons**

    * **Directory**: In this case, it specifies the icon to be used with Directories.

    * **ParentDirectory**: This entry is used to assign a Icon to the "go to the parent 
      directory" action.

    * **Default**: This is the icon that will be shown if any of the previous ones matched.
