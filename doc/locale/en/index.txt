Cherokee 0.6 Documentation
==========================

Welcome to the 0.6 documentation.


Compiling and Installing
------------------------

If you are not comfortable with rolling your own Cherokee, then check our 
listings of pre-compiled binaries_.
Specific instructions for building your own copy are available at: 

    - Unix_
    - Windows_

Configuration Interface
-----------------------

Cherokee provides an administration interface named `Cherokee Admin`_
that allows to configure the web server without having to worry about
editing a text file written with a certain syntax.

General configuration
---------------------

There are a number a `general configuration`_ entries that specify the
most significant configuration options such as the port - or ports -
that the server will listen to, the default timeout, whether to
support keep-alive connections and so on.

Virtual Servers
---------------

If you want your web server to work with more than one `virtual
server`_ you will have just to create them. Each more will have a
complete independent configuration: paths, behavior, logging
facilities, etc.

Encoders
--------

The encoders allow to transform whatever information the server 
is sending as a response of a request, no matter what handler 
is generating it. 

    - gzip_ - **GZip compression**
    
      Encodes the output with GZip

Icons
-----

The icons_ configuration associates an icon image with one or more file 
extensions. This information will be used mainly by the dirlist_ handler.

Modules
-------

----------
Validators
----------
    - htdigest_ - **Htdigest**
    
      Uses something to perform HTTP authentication.

    - htpasswd_ - **Htpasswd**

      Uses something to perform HTTP authentication.
    
    - ldap_ - **LDAP Authentication**
    
      Uses an LDAP directory to perform HTTP authentication.

    - mysql_ - **MySQL Authentication**
      
      Uses a MySQL database to perform HTTP authentication.
    
    - pam_ - **PAM Authentication**
    
      Uses PAM to perform HTTP authentication.
    
    - plain_ - **Plain Flat File Authentication**
    
      Uses a plain flat file to perform HTTP authentication.

---------
Balancers
---------
    - `round robin`_ - **Round Robin load balancer**
    

Advanced topics
---------------

The administration interface is highly recommended, and is in fact the
only administration mechanism that should be used to configure
Cherokee. However, there is another way in which Cherokee developers
and very advance users can modify the configuration.

The default location for Cherokee configuration files is
``/etc/cherokee``, but this may vary based on distribution or
installation parameters. It is a specially formatted text file that can
be modified by hand if you are completely sure about what you are
doing. We recommend you not to do so.

There are some `advanced options`_ which might help you in the process
of modifying this file. Again: It is only supposed to be modified by
advanced users.
