Shared Options
==============

There are a few options which are shared for all the handlers: 


OnlySecure
~~~~~~~~~~
This configuration entry determines that the directory will be served by the secure 
server (*https*) only.

If you access directory /admin or any sub-directory, throught non-secure connection 
Cherokee will report a **426 Upgrade Required error**.


Allow From
~~~~~~~~~~
This parameter lets you set up rules form allow access to the directory contents to
some IP or IP ranges. The remote client IP will be checked with all the provided 
list and only if the IP matches with some of the rules the access will be allowed.

There are three possible entry types:

    * IP addresses
    * Host names
    * IP ranges 

In the two cases, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are valid.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
Allow access only from the IPv6 localhost address::

   Allow from ::1

Allow access from the 127.0.0.0/8 network::

   Allow from 127.0.0.0/8

or it could also we written like::

   Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0

It is also possible to use lists instead of a single IP or network range. And ir is 
also possible to mix IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and networks if you want::

    Allow from 192.168.0.0/16, ::1, 10.0.0.1, 3ffe:3200::/24


Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This parameter allows to configure user/password protected entries. A validator 
has to be used in each Auth entry in order to specify the validaton mechanism. 
Eg: PAM_, htpasswd_, htdigest_, plain_, ldap_, mysql_.

It accepts two kinds of validation schemes:

    * Basic
    * Digest 

It is also possible to specify who is allowed to access the resource using the Users entry.
