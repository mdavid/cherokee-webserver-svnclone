CGI executing
=============

The cgi handler executes CGI programs.

This module accepts three parameters:

    * **Script Alias**: It defines a kind of execution interpreter
    * **ErrorHandler**: Use CGI output as error message
    * **ChangeUser**: It interprets each CGI as it owner user 


Examples
--------

This is a pretty common example. It defines a directory called cgi which points 
to a path out of the Sever root directory where are located the CGI programs.

This example shows how to use the script alias parameter. When /example is visited, 
it will run /usr/lib/cgi-bin/awstats.pl
