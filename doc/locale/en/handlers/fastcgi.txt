FastCGI
=======

The fcgi handler queries to [FastCGI] servers, such as PHP, in order to execute
scripts. It is basically the same thing as CGI but *much faster*.

**Note**
	   The "fastcgi" module also implements the FastCGI protocol. It is a  
	   more complete implementation than "fcgi" although it is also more  
	   complex. Actually, fcgi become the standard choice because the PHP  
	   interpreter was kind of buggy when it had to demultiplex multiple  
	   requests from the same socket.

This module accepts one parameter, and at the same time, supports all the 
CGI handler parameters:

    * Server path or hostname:port: It defines a server entry 

Each Server parameter accepts these sub-parameters:

    * Interpreter: Defines the command line of the interpreter for this 
      server. This sub-parameter only available for FastCGI servers which are 
      running in the same computer with the webserver. The webserver will try to run 
      the command line if it fails to connect to the specified address in Server 
      parameter. If you run the FastCGI servers manually, this sub-parameter is not needed.

    * Env variable:value pair: Set an environment variable for the FastCGI servers. 

      The **PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN** environment variable is mandatory for PHP FastCGI servers. 
      It defines how much children should serve the requests coming from the webserver. 

      If you define **PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS**, the value should be negative so that PHP would 
      take the request as much as possible. If you left it unset, PHP will take the 
      default value (500) and your 500th request will be rejected and FCGI handler will 
      spew Error 500 (Internal server error) for it. 


If multiple Server entries defined, the requests will be round-robinly served by 
each of Server entry.

Parameters               Type            Description
=======================  ==============  ======================================
Script Alias             String          It defines a kind of execution interpreter

Change to UID            String          It interprets each CGI as it owner user 

Error handler            Boolean         Use CGI output as error message 

Check file               Boolean         Checks whether the target exists for 
                                         building the PATH_INFO

Pass request             Boolean         Pass the all the special headers of the

Examples
--------
This example shows a typical usage of FastCGI. It connects to a FastCGI server located 
in localhost in port 8002. If no server is running, the webserver will run the FastCGI 
server by issuing command defined in Interpreter sub-parameter:

This example shows a typical usage of multiple FastCGI servers. It connects to a 
FastCGI servers located in several locations. If no server is running in the local 
computer, the webserver will run the FastCGI server by issuing command defined in 
Interpreter sub-parameter. Note that for remote FastCGI servers, you are responsible
to run the FastCGI servers there manually:
