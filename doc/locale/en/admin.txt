Cherokee Admin
==============

This section describes the Cherokee configuration admin interface. It is designed to
make the configuration of the cherokee web server really easy.

If cherokee is going to be running in the same host, just use::

	$cherokee-admin

And redirect your internet browser to 127.0.0.1:9090. By default, the interface will
be listening on port 9090 at 127.0.0.1. There are some advanced options thought:

    * **-h**: Show usage
    * **-a**: Listen all interfaces
    * **-C**: Use a different configuration file
    * **-d**: Use a custom admin-interface path

Example::

	$cherokee-admin -a -P 9091 -C /etc/cherokee/cherokee2.conf -d /path/to/svn/trunk/cherokee-admin/
