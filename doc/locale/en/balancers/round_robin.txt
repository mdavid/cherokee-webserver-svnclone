Round Robin
===========



Each Server parameter accepts these sub-parameters:

    * Interpreter: Defines the command line of the interpreter for this 
      server. This sub-parameter only available for FastCGI servers which are 
      running in the same computer with the webserver. The webserver will try to run 
      the command line if it fails to connect to the specified address in Server 
      parameter. If you run the FastCGI servers manually, this sub-parameter is not needed.

    * Env variable:value pair: Set an environment variable for the FastCGI servers. 


If multiple Server entries defined, the requests will be round-robinly served by 
each of Server entry.
