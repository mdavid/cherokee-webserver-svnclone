===================
Server Configuation
===================

Binding
-------

When the server starts up it will need to bind to a port to listen for
connections.  By default Cherokee will attempt to listen on port 80, the HTTP
protocol standard port.  You can define which port Cherokee listens on with the
configuration::

    server!port = 80

To listen on port 80 you will need root privileges.  Any port greater than 1024
will not need root privileges.  The ``server!port`` configuration just tells
Cherokee to bind the HTTP protocol to the given port.  To adjust the port number
for TLS/SSL you must use::

    server!port_tls = 443

Port 443 is the HTTPS standard port and is set by default.
