Virtual Servers
---------------

'Virtual Server' is an abstraction mechanism that allows you to define a custom 
number of parameters and rules that have to be applied to one or more domains.

In a Cherokee server there must be at least one virtual server named default, 
and there is no maximum number. 
It is important to know that this server cannot be deleted.

When the server receives a request it will try to match the domain name specified 
in the virtual server that should handle it. In case no virtual server matches 
the request, default will be used.


Add new Virtual Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You have to enter the server name and a valid Document Root directory in 
order to create a new virtual server.

* Document Root
  This directive sets the directory from which Cherokee will serve files. 
  The set of rules is checked from the highest to the lowest possible priority. 
  Once a rule is matched, the server appends the path from the requested URL to 
  the document root to make the path to the document. If it is a directory, this 
  information is used. If other rules apply to a parent directory, those are applied 
  as well without overwriting the original behavior::

  	 http://www.example.com/index.html refers to /var/www/index.html

  This might seem complicated but it's actually simple to understand. For example suppose 
  you had a directory called /secret that was protected with authentication, and there
  was also a rule with higher priority for /secret/cgi that only specified to use 
  the CGI handler. Under these circumstances, if a request was received for 
  /secret/cgi/something then the CGI handler would be taken and it would inherit the 
  authentication specified for /secret.

* Name

  Name is an alias. The domain names handled by the virtual server should be 
  specified later in the virtual server details page.


Now, we can configure our new virtual server. 

Basics
~~~~~~

  * Directory Indexes

    The DirectoryIndex directive sets the list of resources to look for when 
    the client requests an index of the directory by specifying a / at the end 
    of the directory name. Several URLs may be given, in which case the server 
    will return the first one that it finds. If none of the resources exist, the 
    server will reply according to the handler behavior.

    Note that the documents do not need to be relative to the directory::

 	    DirectoryIndex index.html, index.txt, /cgi-bin/index.pl

    would cause the CGI script /cgi-bin/index.pl to be executed if neither 
    index.html nor index.txt existed in a directory.

    There is a special case in which the directory index entry starts with 
    a slash. For example, /cgi-bin/index.pl. In that case, it will use it as 
    the object accessible under that public address of the same virtual server,
    so it will take care about the possible configuration of 
    the /cgi-bin/ directory and/or the pl extension.


Domain names
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Set's the FQDN that will match with the virtual server::

    		xyz.com, www.xyz.com, xyz.org, xyz.org

Behavior
~~~~~~~~
  There is a common group of parameters which modify the server behavior. It 
  can be configured depending on the directory requested, the extension of the 
  file requested or a regular expression. 

  * **Directory**: The entry Directory encloses a group of directives which will
    apply only to the named directory and sub-directories of that directory. 

  * **Extensions**: The entry Extensions doesn't care about directories, it will 
    just look for the extension of the object requested. 

  * **Regular Expressions**: The Request entry provides a powerful way to apply 
    custom options to requests. It is a complement for the Directory and Extension 
    entries. Basically, there are two differences between them:

    + It uses regular expressions to define the requests in which the configuration 
      will be applied.

    + These entries are able to use the connection parameters (both pathinfo 
      and query string). In this way, it is possible to set rules based on 
      parameter values. 

  * The priority which will be applied (the bigger, the higher).

Error Handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  We can easily redirect errors to a custom path or website.

Logging
~~~~~~~
  The loggers are a type of Cherokee modules to write the server log information using 
  different destinations and/or formats: 

    * Destination: File, syslog, data base, etc.
    * Format: Combined_, NCSA_, W3C_

  If a virtual server doesn't have a logger set up it will not log anything.

Security
~~~~~~~~
  The virtual server must be configured with the path to the certificate before using 
  secure connections (https). There is a document which might help to generate SSL keys_
