Configuration
=============

**Note**
	   Cherokee provides an administration interface named  `Cherokee Admin`_
	   that allows to configure the web server without having to worry about
	   editing a text file written with a certain syntax. 

Once the ``cherokee-admin`` server is launched, there will be an
administration web interface available at http://localhost:9090/ ready
to work with the configuration.

Binding
-------
When the server is initiated it opens a port and starts listening to incoming 
requests. By default this is port 80 and it will use all the 
network interfaces of the machine, which is usually the desired behavior. 


IPv6 support
------------
The IPv6 configuration key brings the possibility of activating or deactivating 
the IPv6 support at the server. If Cherokee has been compiled with IPv6 
support (--with-ipv6), this configuration entry will be fully functional, 
otherwise it will be ignored.


Timeout
-------
Sets the number of seconds that Cherokee will wait before closing the 
connection. 


KeepAlive
---------
Enables the global keep-alive support for the client requests.
It increases the client performance by reusing a connection for more 
than one request. It should most probably be turned on.

Server Tokens

=========================  =======================================
Parameters                 Description
=========================  =======================================
Product                    Cherokee
Minor                      Cherokee/0.0
Minimal                    Cherokee/0.0.0
OS                         Cherokee/0.0.0 (UNIX)
Full                       Cherokee/0.0.0 (UNIX) Ext/0.0 Ext2/0.0
=========================  =======================================

By default, Cherokee will use **Full**.


Execution User and Group
------------------------
The User directive configures which user the Cherokee daemon will normally 
run as. By default, Cherokee runs as root which is considered undesirable 
in all but the most trustful network configurations. 

The User directive used in conjunction with the Group directive instructs 
the daemon to switch to the specified user and group as quickly as 
possible after startup. 

There are two possible formats: using the user or group name, or using 
the system ID.


Developers
----------
The administration interface is highly recommended, and is in fact the
only administration mechanism that should be used to configure
Cherokee. However, there is another way in which Cherokee developers
and very advance users can modify the configuration.

The default location for Cherokee configuration files is
``/etc/cherokee``, but this may vary based on distribution or
installation parameters. It is a specially formatted text file that can
be modified by hand if you are completely sure about what you are
doing. We recommend you not to do so.

There is a document explaining how the `internal configuration
system`_ works and its main keys.
