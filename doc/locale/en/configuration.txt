=============
Configuration
=============

The default location for Cherokee configuration files are ``/etc/cherokee``, but this may vary based on distribution or installation parameters.

Files

cherokee.conf
    This is the main configuration file that Cherokee will look for.  It will
    typically include server and virtual server configuration.  You are not
    limited to put all of your configuration in this file.  Cherokee supports
    configuation inclusion with the use of ``include``.

******
Syntax
******

The syntax to the Cherokee configuration may look cryptic initially.  However, it is very logical and with a little bit of studying will come pretty natural.  The configuration is esstenially a tree of nodes.  Each node is delimited with a ``!`` character.  Take a look at the following example::

    server!port = 80

This tells the server that it should listen on port 80.  To get a little more complex take a look at this example::

    vserver!default!priority = 1

This defines the priority to 1 for the default virtual server.  You can take a look at the Virtual Server documentation to get a better idea of what is possible.

**************************
Inclusion of Configuration
**************************

Sometimes it is nice to break out your configuration into several logical files to be more modular as well as more organized.  You can use the ``include`` configuration to accomplish this.  Here is an example::

    include = /etc/cherokee/advanced.conf
