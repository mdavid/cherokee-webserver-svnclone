=============
Configuration
=============

Cherokee provides an administration interface name ``cherokee-admin``
that allows to configure the web server without having to worry about
editing a text file written with a certain syntax. 

Once the ``cherokee-admin`` server is launched, there will be an
administration web interface available at http://localhost:9090/ ready
for working with the configuration.

Developers

The administration interface is highly recommended, and in fact the
only administration mechanism that should be used to configure
Cherokee. However, there is another way in which Cherokee developers
and very advance users can modify the configuration.

The default location for Cherokee configuration file is
``/etc/cherokee``, but this may vary based on distribution or
installation parameters. It is a special formatted text file than can
be modified by hand if you are completely sure about what you are
doing. We recommend you not do so.

There is a document explaining how the `internal configuration
system`_ works and its main keys.
