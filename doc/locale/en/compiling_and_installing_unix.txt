Compiling and installing on Unix
================================

Dependencies
------------
The following requirements exist for building Cherokee:

* Building tools: Cherokee is built on top of the autoconf and automake 
  tools, hence your systems has to have some basic system programs like a sh 
  shell, make and an ANSI C compiler. We have compiled Cherokee in various 
  platforms with different compilers, so it shouldn't be a problem.

* Optional: 

  * Python: Cherokee includes a number of Quality Assurance tests 
    written in Python language. If you are planning to contribute code
    into the project, or you just want to test everything is working in 
    the server, you will need a Python interpreter installed on your system.

    * Python docutils: in order to generate the documentation from text files. 

  * TLS libraries: Cherokee supports two different SSL/TLS 
    libraries: OpenSSL and GNUTLS. You need to have one of those libraries 
    with its development files. 


The simplest way
----------------

First, download_ a fresh copy of Cherokee, then run:

    - $> **./configure --localstatedir=/var --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
      --with-wwwroot=/var/www** To configure the package for your system.   
    - $> **make** To compile the package.
    - $> **make install** To install the programs and any data files.


Install and config directories
------------------------------

If you need to auto-start cherokee at boot (through init's runlevel) you can 
find a start/stop script in the contrib source directory::

	cp contrib/cherokee /etc/init.d/

Additionally, you need to create symlinks at the correct rc directory of the 
appropiate runlevel. This can can be done in many ways and usually each distribution 
offers its own tools to do so. 

Others arguments
----------------

If you want to learn more about ``configure`` you can run **./configure --help**

=========================  =======================================


Debugging tools
---------------
If you need to debug the behavior of the web server (or an application), there 
are some helpful tools available for you. 

* To start with, if you are using gcc and you want to compile Cherokee
  with debug information just execute make like this::

    make CFLAGS="-O0 -g3"

  And then you'll be able to execute gdb, cgdb, gdbtui..  

* You can use autoconf to set up Cherokee to use static modules::

    ./autogen.sh --localstatedir=/var --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
    --with-wwwroot=/var/www --enable-static-module=all --enable-static --enable-shared=no 

* You can also enable a new cool feature: CHEROKEE_TRACE, which will let you trace the
  behavior with a human-readable output::

   --enable-trace

Now, when you are going to launch the web server, just add the CHEROKEE_TRACE variable, 
with the desired options::

	cherokee# CHEROKEE_TRACE="common" cherokee
	Cherokee Web Server 0.6.0 (Mar  8 2008): Listening on port 80, TLS disabled
	IPv6 enabled, using epoll, 1024 fds system limit, max. 507 connections
	5 threads, 206 fds per thread, standard scheduling policy
	handler_common.c:0143 (                     stat_file): /var/www//images/powered_by_cherokee.png, use_iocache=0 re=0
	handler_common.c:0190 (   cherokee_handler_common_new): request: '/images/powered_by_cherokee.png', local: '/var/www//images/powered_by_cherokee.png', exists 1
	handler_common.c:0236 (   cherokee_handler_common_new): going for handler_file
	handler_common.c:0143 (                     stat_file): /var/www//images/default-bg.png, use_iocache=0 re=0
	handler_common.c:0190 (   cherokee_handler_common_new): request: '/images/default-bg.png', local: '/var/www//images/default-bg.png', exists 1
	handler_common.c:0236 (   cherokee_handler_common_new): going for handler_file
	handler_common.c:0143 (                     stat_file): /var/www//images/cherokee-logo.png, use_iocache=0 re=0
	handler_common.c:0190 (   cherokee_handler_common_new): request: '/images/cherokee-logo.png', local: '/var/www//images/cherokee-logo.png', exists 1
	handler_common.c:0236 (   cherokee_handler_common_new): going for handler_file

Of course, you can trace all the modules (handlers, loggers..) you need::

   CHEROKEE_TRACE="common,static,io_cache" /usr/bin/cherokee
   CHEROKEE_TRACE="all" /usr/bin/cherokee
