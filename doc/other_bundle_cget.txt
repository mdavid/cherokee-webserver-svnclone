Man pages: cget
---------------

This is an accessory tool developed for testing purposes of the
capabilities of Cherokee in the early releases. Over the time new
functionalities were included and now it can be a really handy
tool. You might find it useful for your own scripts, especially for
its ability to read and write HTTP headers.

It can handle both HTTP and HTTPS requests.

This is the full information provided by the manpage:
