Upgrading Cherokee
------------------

If there is a prepackaged version of Cherokee for you platform of
choice, we strongly encourage you to use it. Although upgrading
Cherokee is not complicated, the prepackaged versions should make your
upgrades much easier.

Refer to the link:basic_installation_unix.html#APT[APT] section of the
Unix installation instructions if you are using Debian or Ubuntu for
some additional information.

The current mechanism of choice to configure Cherokee did not exist
prior to release 0.6. A lot has happened since then, and Cherokee has
been constantly improving in terms of stability, efficiency and
features.

If you happen to be running an old version of Cherokee and would like
to keep your current configuration settings, you can upgrade your
cherokee.conf file.

Cherokee now supports configuration versioning, so
from now on, whenever a change is made to the configuration file
format, Cherokee-Admin will be able to automatically convert yours to
the new release. You simply have to load Cherokee-Admin and it will be
converted once you proceed to saving it.

There is also a command line utility that you can use to do the exact
same thing. It is provided under
`$prefix/share/cherokee/admin/upgrade_config.py.`

In case you need to do this manually, the usage is as follows:

----
  /usr/share/cherokee/admin/upgrade_config.py /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf
----

If Cherokee-Admin can not make the conversion automatically (because
it is older than the configuration versioning feature), you still have
options.

You can attempt to upgrade you configuration file by manually running
the Python scripts provided under `contrib`.

The usage is quite simple, and works the same way for all the
scripts:

----
    cp /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf-0.99.9
    contrib/0999to09910.py /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf-0.99.9 /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf
----

If you need to upgrade from a really old release, simply apply the
whole chain of conversions.

Note that some of the available prepackaged versions of Cherokee
are set to offer the possibility of automatically running these scripts
to upgrade the configuration if files from a prior release are detected
in the system.

Every effort is made to bulletproof the upgrade scripts. If any of
them does not work for you, please send a bug report.
However, Cherokee is a very active project and has been steadily
advancing and incorporating technical improvements. You should really be
using link:bundle_cherokee-admin.html[cherokee-admin] to configure your
system if you want to take full advantage of the new features. Even if
the upgrade process is successful, you should use the new configuration
file as a start point and go through the normal configuration process
using link:bundle_cherokee-admin.html[cherokee-admin].

Also, as long as you are not using an ancient configuration file,
every new cherokee-admin release will be able to upgrade the
configuration automatically from previous versions whenever a format
change has been required.
