Development: Open issues
------------------------

This section of the documentation comprehends a variety of topics. It
is mainly intended as a repository of notes, tips, issues and
documentation concerning parts of Cherokee that are currently under
development -or are full developed- but are not yet included for
mainstream usage.

As these features get properly integrated into the Cherokee
infrastructure, the notes regarding the subject should be moved to
their specific section of the docmentation.

For now, this document mantains a list of currently open issues. It
mostly is useful to list things of the Cherokee Project that are known
to be half-baked, and as such are only of interest for developers.

[[fastcgi]]
FastCGI Handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two handlers currently implementing the FastCGI protocol:
"fcgi" and "fastcgi".

The "fastcgi" module also implements the FastCGI protocol. It is a
more complete implementation than "fcgi" although it is also more
complex. Actually, fcgi became the standard choice because the PHP
interpreter is kind of buggy when it has to demultiplex multiple
requests from the same socket. As such, it is the only one supported
by Cherokee-Admin.

The "fastcgi" handler will eventually become the default option
because it is faster and more standard-compliant. However, at the
moment "fcgi" is a better option.
