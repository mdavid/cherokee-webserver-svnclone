Cherokee Bundle: cherokee
-------------------------

This command-line tool is a wrapper for the main Cherokee
executable. It is used as a safety net to invoke `cherokee-worker` and
to ensure it is always functioning. It also plays an important role in
the link:other_goodies.html#zero-downtime[zero-downtime] mechanism
implemented to allow graceful restarts of the server.

This is the full information provided by the manpage.
**********************************************************************
*NAME*::
       cherokee - Cherokee web server safe invoker

*SYNOPSIS*::
       cherokee

*DESCRIPTION*::

Cherokee is an extremely fast, flexible and embeddable web
server. `cherokee` is the recommended way to invoke
`cherokee-worker`. It will launch Cherokee with any options specified
to it via the command line, and monitor it. In case Cherokee ends
abnormally, it will be immediately re-launched.

This program was previously called cherokee-guardian, but became the
main binary to invoke Cherokee since release 0.9.
