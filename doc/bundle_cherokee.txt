Cherokee Bundle: cherokee
-------------------------

This is the main Cherokee program. It can be launched in several ways
as shown in the section link:basics_running_cherokee.txt[Running
Cherokee]. Unless specified otherwise, `cherokee` will try to run with
the configuration present in your default
link:dev_cherokee.conf.html[cherokee.conf] file.

This is the full information provided by the manpage:
**********************************************************************
*NAME*::
       `cherokee` - Cherokee Web Server

*SYNOPSIS*::
       `cherokee` [options]

*DESCRIPTION*::
       `cherokee` is an extremely fast, flexible and embeddable web server.

*OPTIONS*::
       This command will launch the Cherokee webserver. It accepts the following options.

       -h, --help;;
               Prints a brief help message and terminates execution

       -V, --version;;
               Prints Cherokeeâ€™s version and terminates execution

       -t, --test;;
               Perform a sanity check on the configuration  file.  The  server will not run.

       -d, --detach;;
               Launches  the server as a background process (default behaviour is to stay attached to the controlling terminal).

       -C, --config=PATH;;
               Specifies  a  configuration  file  other   than   the   default /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf

       -p, --port=PORT;;
               TCP port number to which the server will listen.

       -r, --documentroot=PATH;;
               Launches  a server exposing statically the specified directory. When launched with -r, the configuration file is  ignored, and the Cherokee instance runs with its default values.

       -i, --print;;
               Print server technical information.
**********************************************************************

To illustrate the usefulness of such options take the following
example:

----
$ cherokee -p 8080 -r `pwd`
----

This would allow any non-privileged user to statically share the
contents of the current directory. A great way to share files in a
local network whenever you are in a hurry. Remember that in Unix
systems only processes launched by the superuser have privileges to
be hooked to the lower 1024 ports of the system.
