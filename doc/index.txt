Cherokee Documentation
----------------------

Welcome to the Cherokee {cherokee_version} documentation.

Compiling and Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not comfortable with rolling your own Cherokee, then check our 
listings of pre-compiled link:http://www.cherokee-project.com/downloads.html[binaries].
Specific instructions for building your own copy are available at: 

    - link:compiling_and_installing_unix.html[Unix]
    - link:compiling_and_installing_windows.html[Windows]

Configuration Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cherokee provides an administration interface named link:admin.html[Cherokee Admin] 
that allows to configure the web server without having to worry about
editing a text file written with a certain syntax.

General configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number a link:general.html[general configuration] entries that specify the
most significant configuration options such as the port - or ports -
that the server will listen to, the default timeout, whether to
support keep-alive connections and so on.

Virtual Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want your web server to work with more than one link:vserver.html[virtual server] 
you will have just to create them. Each more will have a
complete independent configuration: paths, behavior, logging
facilities, etc.

Encoders
~~~~~~~~

The encoders allow to transform whatever information the server 
is sending as a response of a request, no matter what handler 
is generating it. 

    - link:modules_encoders_gzip.html[gzip] - GZip compression
    
      Encodes the output with GZip

Icons
~~~~~

The link:icons.html[icons] configuration associates an icon image with one or more file 
extensions. This information will be used mainly by the link:modules_handlers_dirlist.html[dirlist] handler.

Advanced topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an link:advanced.html[advanced section] that allows to configure the most
complex parameters of the server and how it works with the operating
system.

If you are unsure about any of the options presented within the
advanced section, we recommend you to not change it and use the
default value.

Other advanced topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - link:debug.html[Debugging] Cherokee
    - How to link:cross_compile_cherokee.html[cross compile Cherokee] (Win32 from Linux or OS X)
    - How to link:How_to_generate_SSL_keys.html[generate SSL keys]

Internal configuration system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administration interface is highly recommended, and is in fact the
only administration mechanism that should be used to configure
Cherokee. However, there is another way in which Cherokee developers
and very advance users can modify the configuration.

The link:internal_configuration.html[internal configuration system] text file format is documented so
if you are completely sure about what you are doing, you can modify it
by hand. We recommend you not to do so.

The default location for Cherokee configuration files is
``/etc/cherokee``, but this may vary based on distribution or
installation parameters.
