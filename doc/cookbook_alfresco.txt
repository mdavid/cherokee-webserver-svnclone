Cookbook: Setting up Alfresco
-----------------------------

For this recipe we will be using
link:http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Download_Alfresco_Community_Network[Alfresco
Labs 3c], the community supported release.

You can use the full blown installer or simply download the _WAR file
only_ version. We will be using the former method, but you could
choose the latter and just deploy the application in your favorite
application server. For this you could refer to the
link:cookbook_glassfish.html[Glassfish] recipe and the rest of this
document would be of no more concern to you.

Before we proceed with the installation of Alfresco Lab 3c on Linux,
you must know that it uses JDK 1.5+, MySQL and Tomcat as application
server.

We will be installing the package and then setting up Cherokee as a
reverse proxy to access this Enterprise Content Management solution.

Phase one: Alfresco
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've downloaded the full installer, the process is as simple as
running it and follow the easy step by step assistant.

If you choose to run it as root, it will be installed in
`/opt/Alfresco` by default and will be available system-wide. If not,
your home directory will be chosen.

The process is fairly straight forward.

When you are asked for an OpenOffice location, you can select the
Alfresco directory if you don't want to use it for Office document
conversions. If you can't seem to find a path that lets the installer
proceed, it could be that the installer is trying to look for the file
`soffice.exe`. There is information about this problem in their
link:http://wiki.alfresco.com[wiki], but you could try copying or
making a symbolic link to `/usr/bin/soffice` while the installer gets
fixed. We will simply be ignoring this step.

This should do for now. Now you have to launch Alfresco.

----
# /opt/Alfresco/alfresco.sh start
----

If you experience problems or notice a wrong JRE path, you should edit
the script and modify the `JRE_HOME` variable to whatever Java version
you have on your system.

For instance, it could show:

----
Using JRE_HOME:       /usr
----

By simply looking to your files you could find out the correct version
you have in your system.

----
# ls -l /usr/lib/jvm
total 8
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   14 2008-11-12 11:13 default-java -> java-6-openjdk
drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4096 2008-11-12 11:13 java-6-openjdk
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   19 2008-11-19 01:25 java-6-sun -> java-6-sun-1.6.0.10
drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 2008-11-19 01:25 java-6-sun-1.6.0.10
----

In this case, we would be setting JRE_HOME  to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.10`

After giving the script some seconds to launch the application server,
you can now access Alfresco by visiting
link:http://localhost:8080/share[http://localhost:8080/share]

[[Cherokee]]
Phase two: Cherokee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now to set up Cherokee. To do this, use the provided `Wizard`. Launch
Cherokee-Admin on your proxy machine and then you will find this
assistant under the `Platforms` category of the Wizards. Simply go to
the virtual server list page and click on the `Add` button at the top
of the panel to show the list of available wizards. Click on the one
for Alfresco, answer a few questions and you are done. You can then
skip the rest of this document.

Should you have any problem with the assistant, you can perform the
same tasks manually. Simply set up Cherokee as reverse proxy. You can
either create a new virtual server with a matching rule (be it
`default` or anything else) if you are sharing the proxy machine, or
dedicate another machine to the Proxy Handler. This will be our
choice, since typically you will be wanting to get the best possible
performance, the Java application server is heavy by definition, and
you could be using the proxy machine also to serve other contents. We
are only going to set Cherokee's HTTP reverse proxy handler to hit the
server running Alfresco at port 8080.

Launch Cherokee-Admin on your proxy machine, create a rule that
matches the desired path on your web server hierarchy -`/share` for
instance- in your virtual server of choice, and define the `HTTP
reverse proxy` handler from within the `Handler` tab.

Remember to configure an URL rewriting rule in the handler's
configuration. Alfresco's application server doesn't provide content
directly in the document root, so we'll have to add the required
subnode.

[options="header"]
|================================
|Regular Expression |Substitution
|                   |/share/$1
|================================

You will need to assign it an information source you define for the
server running Alfresco. We will assume the IP is `192.168.1.100` in
your firewalled local network, and your reverse proxy is accessible as
`http://example.com/`

This information source is to be defined as external sources, like
the following example:

[options="header"]
|===========================================
|Type        |Nick       |Connection
|Remote host |alfresco   |192.168.1.100:8080
|===========================================

Refer to the link:modules_handlers_proxy.html[HTTP reverse proxy]
documentation if you need any further help with this.

Once you launch Cherokee and access `http://example.com/share`, you
should be presented with the login screen from before, since you will
be receiving whatever is at `http://192.168.1.100:8080/share`.
