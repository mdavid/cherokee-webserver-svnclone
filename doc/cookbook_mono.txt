Cookbook: Setting up ASP.NET
----------------------------

To run ASP.NET applications with Cherokee, you will need to install
link:http://www.mono-project.com/[Mono]. The Mono Project is a UNIX
version of the Microsoft .NET development platform aimed at enabling
UNIX developers to build and deploy cross-platform .NET Applications.

You will specifically need to run the _mono-fastcgi-server_, since
that is the backend needed to set up Cherokee with the FastCGI handler
to parse and compile aspx code.

You have several options available to obtain this.
If you are lucky enough, it will already be available in your favorite
platform.

On Debian Lenny and Sid, and on Ubuntu 8.10+ (Intrepid and Jaunty) you
can simply leave to APT the trouble of setting up the dependencies by
typing:

----
# apt-get install mono-fastcgi-server2
----

The official supported packages can be found at
link:http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html[the downlad
site]. If your flavor is not there, for Linux you can either:

* Download the binary installer, which is the
link:http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/archive/1.9.1/linux-installer/2/mono-1.9.1_2-installer.bin[release
1.9.1] at the time of writing,

* Download and compile the sources, avialable at the
link:http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/sources-stable/[sources page]. The
fastcgi-server is provided by the
link:http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/sources/xsp/xsp-2.0.tar.bz2[XSP] package.

You can find all sorts of information about the configuration of Mono
at the link:http://www.mono-project.com/[Mono Project] web site.

Once you have a FastCGI Mono backend available, we can proceed with
the recipe.

.Preparations

. Define an link:config_info_sources.html[information source] that
  spawns the _fastcgi-mono-server_. In our example we will be binding
  it to the local interface, port 8080, with our application located
  in `/var/www`, which is our document root. It will be mapped to `/`
  by the FastCGI Mono Server. To do this, we will create a source
  called _mono_, and we will set up the interpreter as:
+
----
fastcgi-mono-server2 --socket=tcp:8080 --address=127.0.0.1 --applications=/:/var/www
----
+
Of course you could also define the parameters through environment
variables, and simply launch the interpreter as:
+
----
fastcgi-mono-server2
----
+
Lets assume we wanted to do so and also wished to use it through a
Unix socket instead of through a host:port combination. You would have
to define at least the following variables:
+
----
MONO_FCGI_APPLICATIONS=/:/var/www
MONO_FCGI_SOCKET=unix
MONO_FCGI_FILENAME=/tmp/cherokee-mono.socket
----
+
Make sure to set up a relatively high spawning timeout, because it can
take its time and you don't want Cherokee giving up before the process
is spawned. A value of 30 seconds should suffice. Obviously this value
is way too high to serve contents when the FastCGI Mono backend has
not been spawned. It is only meant to be used a security
measure. Spawning the process before putting the server into
production is highly recommended.

. Map your information source to a rule that handles your Mono
  application. This can be done by setting up the rule for extensions
  or paths.

  - The first alternative is easily achievable by passing the 11
    standard extensions to the FastCGI Mono Server, defining a rule
    that uses the information source we just mentioned and applies to
    the extensions: `aspx, asmx, ashx, asax, ascx, soap, rem, axd, cs,
    config, dll`. However, this is not the option recomended by the
    Mono Project since some undesired side effects are obtained, such
    as exposed files and missing features.

  - The second alternative ovecomes this by sending all requests
    directly to the FastCGI Mono Server, but it comes at the cost of a
    performance decrease. It is the recommended option.


So, lets get started. The recipe will configure the FastCGI handler
using paths, deleting all but the `Default` rule from our Cherokee
configuration.

.Steps

. First, access your virtual server configuration and go to the
  `Basics` tab. Add `index.aspx,default.aspx` to the list of
  `Directory Indexes`.

. Then, delete every eraseable rule. The only remaining one should be
  the `Default` one.

. Edit the rule, go to the `Handler` tab and select the FastCGI
  handler. Assign it the _mono_ information source. As always, you can
  set up as many hosts as desired and Cherokee will balance the load
  among them. If you want to take the alternative path of configuring
  Mono through extensions instead of paths, simply define a rule that
  applies to the 11 extensions mentioned above. The handler
  configuration is completely identical.

And that is all. Once you upload your ASP.NET application to
_/var/www_ and launch Cherokee, you should be able to access your
application by pointing your web browser to, lets say
`http://example.net/`.
