Compiling and installing on Unix
--------------------------------

Required
~~~~~~~~

The following requirements exist for building Cherokee:

* Building tools: Cherokee is built on top of the autoconf and automake 
  tools, hence your systems has to have some basic system programs like a sh 
  shell, make and an ANSI C compiler. We have compiled Cherokee in various 
  platforms with different compilers, so it shouldn't be a problem.

Optional
~~~~~~~~ 

  * Python: Cherokee includes a number of Quality Assurance tests 
    written in Python language. If you are planning to contribute code
    into the project, or you just want to test everything is working in 
    the server, you will need a Python interpreter installed on your system.

    * Python docutils: in order to generate the documentation from text files. 

  * TLS libraries: Cherokee supports two different SSL/TLS 
    libraries: OpenSSL and GNUTLS. You need to have one of those libraries 
    with its development files. 

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

. link:download.html[Download] a fresh copy of Cherokee
. Configure the package for your system:
+
----
./configure --localstatedir=/var --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --with-wwwroot=/var/www
----
. Compile the package:
+
----
make
----
. Install the programs and any data files:
+
----
make install
----
. Start Cherokee link:admin.html[admin]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Autostart
~~~~~~~~~

If you need the cherokee webserver to start at boot (through init's runlevel) you can 
find a start/stop script in the contrib source directory:

----
cp contrib/cherokee /etc/init.d/
----

Additionally, you need to create symlinks at the correct rc directory of the 
appropiate runlevel. This can can be done in many ways and usually each distribution 
offers its own tools to do so.
