Modules: Handlers
-----------------

Handlers are the Cherokee modules that actually manage the
connections. You can specify what module actually must handle the
connection for any given rule matched in your
link:config_virtual_servers.html[Virtual servers] settings. Several
are provided to perform a varied set of actions, though it is possible
to develop homebrewed handlers easily once you grasp the basics of
Cherokee's internal architecture.

This is the list of standard handlers provided by Cherokee:

* link:modules_handlers_common.html[common] - **List & Send**.
* link:modules_handlers_file.html[Static Content] - **Static Content**.
* link:modules_handlers_dirlist.html[dirlist] - **Only listing**.
* link:modules_handlers_redir.html[redir] - **Redirection**.
* link:modules_handlers_cgi.html[cgi] - **CGI Execution**.
* link:modules_handlers_fcgi.html[fcgi] - **FastCGI Server Support**.
* link:modules_handlers_scgi.html[scgi] - **SCGI Server Support**.
* link:modules_handlers_server_info.html[Server Info] - **Server
  Info**.
* link:modules_handlers_dbslayer.html[MySQL bridge]: MySQL over HTTP bridge.
* link:modules_handlers_mirror.html[Generic balancer] - **Generic
  balancer**.
* link:modules_handlers_admin.html[Remote Administration] - **Remote
