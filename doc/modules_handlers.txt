Modules: Handlers
-----------------

Handlers are the Cherokee modules that actually manage the
connections. You can specify what module actually must handle the
connection for any given rule matched in your
link:config_virtual_servers.html[Virtual servers] settings. Several
are provided to perform a varied set of actions, though it is possible
to develop homebrewed handlers easily once you grasp the basics of
Cherokee's internal architecture.
