Encoding
--------

The content sent by Cherokee can be encoded or not.
This section is used to configure what
link:modules_encoders.htm[encoders], if any, are to be applied.

You can set up the encoding method to use, and specify the list of
content types to allow or deny to be sent encoded.

Whenever you set up a virtual server,
link:modules_encoders_gzip.html[gzip] is enabled by default for the
following file types: html, htm, txt, css & js

You are encouraged to use this. Hardware is cheap. Bandwidth is not.
