platform. If you do not find a prepackaged version that suits your
needs, you can always download and compile your own.

Advanced parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to learn more about 'configure' you can run `./configure
--help`. The list of parameter is extensive, so you might want to take
a look at it, particularly if you are a developer. Some of the most
used parameters are listed on the
link_basics_installation_unix.html[Unix instructions].


[[autostart]]
Autostart
~~~~~~~~~

If you need the cherokee webserver to start at boot time, you will
have to use the provided Launchd init script. It will be built with
the rest of Cherokee at the root of your build directory. Simply copy
it to the apropriate location and make `launchd` aware of it with the
following commands.

-----------------------------------------
sudo cp org.cherokee.webserver.plist /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cherokee.webserver.plist
