Authentication
--------------

There are two types of authentication:

*basic*::
    This method sends the username and password in clear text over the network.
    It is not the most secure method.  If the connection to the web server is
    through HTTPS then this method is as secure as the encryption used.  This
    method is very easy to implement, so most clients support it.

*digest*::
    This method is by far the most secure, but also more complex.  Most modern
    web browsers support this method.

Cherokee comes with a number of validators: link:modules_validators_htpasswd.html[htpasswd], 
link:modules_validators_htdigest.html[htdigest], link:modules_validators_pam.html[PAM], 
link:modules_validators_ldap.html[LDAP], link:modules_validators_mysql.html[MySQL], 
and a link:modules_validators_plain.html[plain] text file.
