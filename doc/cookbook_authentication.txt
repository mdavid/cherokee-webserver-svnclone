Cookbook: Authentication
------------------------

In this section you will find information useful to set up
authentication mechanisms with several of Cherokee's validators.

You can find information and basic examples in each validator's
documentation. This is the list of validator modules provided by
Cherokee:

* link:modules_validators_htdigest.html[htdigest]
* link:modules_validators_htpasswd.html[htpasswd]
* link:modules_validators_ldap.html[LDAP]
* link:modules_validators_mysql.html[MySQL]
* link:modules_validators_pam.html[PAM]
* link:modules_validators_plain.html[Plain]

You will also find interesting information in the
link:modules_validators_plain.html["Validator Modules Overview"] and
step by step examples for Plain and PAM mechanisms in the
link:config_quickstart.html["Quickstart"] section.

There are two types of authentication:

*basic*::
    This method sends the username and password in clear text over the network.
    It is not the most secure method.  If the connection to the web server is
    through HTTPS then this method is as secure as the encryption used.  This
    method is very easy to implement, so most clients support it.

*digest*::
    This method is by far the most secure, but also more complex.  Most modern
    web browsers support this method.


The details to set up the `htdigest` and `htpasswd` are exactly the
same as for `plain` validation. The only difference is the tools used
to create the passwords' file.


=== htdigest

To use this handler you will need a file created by the `htdigest`
command. It is a tool to manage user files for digest (and basic)
authentication.

****
Syntax::
  htdigest [ -c ] passwdfile realm username

The only optional parameter is `-c`, used to create the passwdfile or
overwrite it if it is present.
****

To create a file for a `testuser` with `testpassword` you would have
to issue:

-----
$ htdigest -c passwords.digest secret testuser
Adding password for testuser in realm secret.
New password:
Re-type new password:

$ cat pass
testuser:secret:f24f76261bcd65780b33edde00855897
-----

=== htpasswd

For this handle, the tool `htpasswd` is needed to create the
files. The basic usage information is this:

*****
Usage::
        htpasswd [-cmdpsD] passwordfile username
+
        htpasswd -b[cmdpsD] passwordfile username password
+
        htpasswd -n[mdps] username
+
        htpasswd -nb[mdps] username password
*****

Refer to its documentation for details about the parameters. For our example, this
will suffice:

----
$ htpasswd -c /var/www/.htpasswd testuser
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user testuser

$ cat /var/www/.htpasswd
testuser:iqLGh2g/7bX7M
----

Remember that it is never recommended to place the file with the
passwords in a location fetchable from the webserver. This is true for
plain validation, htdigest, htpasswd and whatever file based system
you cross paths with.


=== MySQL

Lets set up a simple server requiring authentication against a MySQL
database to fetch any content.

First, lets define a unique rule in our virtual server managed by the
`List and Send` handler. Through the `Security` tab we can configure
it to use MySQL as authentication mechanism. Filling up just the
essential fields will be enough. Realm, database name, user, password
and an SQL query that must return one row with one column as password.

In this case, we have used:

----
SELECT password FROM auth_users WHERE username = '${user}'
----

And that is about it.
In this example you will need a MySQL server running (localhost in
this case, as it takes the default value), a database called
`cherokee` with `cherokee` as user and password, and a table that
suits the shown query.


Assuming you have a MySQL user with privileges granted to create
databases, a MySQL session simliar to this one would suffice:

----
$ mysql -u cherokee -D cherokee -p

mysql> CREATE DATABASE cherokee;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE auth_users(
       username varchar(32),
       password varchar(32),
       PRIMARY KEY (username));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO auth_users VALUES('cherokee','cherokee');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> quit
----

When we are done, our simple virtual server should look like this:

And any content requested to Cherokee will require prior
authentication against the database.
