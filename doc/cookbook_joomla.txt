Cookbook: Setting up Joomla
---------------------------

Setting up link:http://www.joomla.org/[Joomla] with Cherokee is really
easy. We will assume that our `Document Root` directory is `/var/www`
and that we want to install the software on a subdirectory called
`joomla` of the server we are working on.

You will need PHP support correctly configured in Cherokee, and PHP
with the MySQL module installed. The default configuration already
provides a valid PHP configuration for Cherokee if you have php-cgi
installed, but you can follow the appropriate recipe about
link:cookbook_php.html[setting up PHP] in case you don't have it
available for any reason. You will also need an FTP server if the
Joomla files are owned by a user other than the one running the web
server.

Under these conditions, you could start Joomla's installation and you
would already be able to have your site up and running.

However, we can add several refinements. In this recipe we will be
dedicating a virtual server entirely to Joomla, so either create a new
one or adjust `default` accodringly. Of course, you can also set it up
under a directory in an existing virtual server, but we will take the
first approach for clarity and simplicity. And we will make the
modifications in our `default` virtual server. This will only affect
the URLs we'll be accessing to log in to Joomla. First download and
uncompress the distributed Joomla release into `/var/www/joomla`, and
set that path as the `Document Root` in your virtual host's `Basics`
tab.

We will also be making changes in the `Error Handler` tab, selecting
the `Custom redirections` option and adding an option to send errors
to Joomla.

[grid="rows"]
`~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~
Error        , URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
403 Forbidden, /index.php
404 Not Found, /index.php
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now only the database issue remains. Log in to MySQL:

----------------
mysql -u root -p
----------------

And create the database for Joomla. We will be using the name
'joomla', the user 'joomlauser' and the password 'joomlapassword', but
you should set up your own.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE DATABASE joomla;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON joomla.* TO joomlauser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'joomlapassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON joomla.* TO joomlauser@localhost.localdomain IDENTIFIED BY joomla'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then point your web browser to `http://localhost/joomla` and follow
the instructions provided by the Joomla installer.

There is not much else you must do for Cherokee to work with
Joomla. If you follow the Joomla installer's instructions -providing
valid database information in most cases will suffice-, you will go
thorough every step swiftly. Once you are done you will have to
eliminate the `installation` subdirectory, as Joomla does not allow
going any further until you do so as a security precaution. It is also
a good idea to make the `cache` directory world writable.

-----------------------------------
rm -rf /var/www/joomla/installation
chmod 777 /var/www/joomla/cache
-----------------------------------

Now to set up Joomla. Visit
link:http://localhost/administration[http://localhost/administration]
and log in. Go to the `Global Configuration` option and enable all the
*SEO Settings*, including the ones for Apache mod_rewrite.

Finally, set up the rewrite rules recommended by Joomla to block out
the most common type of exploit attempts. To do so, simply create
`Regular Expression` rules for the following expressions:

---------------------------------
mosConfig_[a-zA-Z_]{1,21}(=|\%3D)
base64_encode.*\(.*\)
(\<|%3C).*script.*(\>|%3E)
GLOBALS(=|\[|\%[0-9A-Z]{0,2})
_REQUEST(=|\[|\%[0-9A-Z]{0,2})
---------------------------------

Each should be managed by a handler that returns an error:

[grid="rows"]
`~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Handler   , Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HTTP error, 403 Forbidden
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After this you are done! Remember that all these settings are
refinements not really needed by Joomla to perform its basic
functions.
