Information Sources
-------------------

Every information source to be used by the web server is configured
only once in this section. After that, any virtual server will be able
to use as many as desired without having to set up the same thing over
and over again for every one of the virtual servers.

There are two possible settings as *information sources*:

. *Remote*: Cherokee will simply dispatch the request to the specified
  host. As many hosts as needed can be added, and Cherokee will simply
  apply the balancing strategy to which the information source is
  asinged among them. If for any reason the requests made to these
  hosts could not be performed, the processes would simply fail.

. *Local*: As before, many hosts can be specified (despite the name,
  the selection is not limited to the localhost). This works the same
  way as the previous option. But in this case, if a request cannot be
  responded then instead of failing directly a specified command would
  be launched before reconnecting to try again. The most common use of
  this would be launching the service that should handle the request,
  but it is a flexible mechanism that in theory could allow you to
  reroute the information to allow you to serve SSH sessions via your
  webserver or any other neat tricks you can think of.


Note that because of Cherokee's flexibility and modularity, sometimes
and deppending of the situation one or the other setting might not
make much sense. In such ocasions `cherokee-admin` will simply hide
whatever options do not apply.

Unix Sockets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that information sources can be adressed by host:port or directly
through Unix sockets. You only have to specify a full path to the
socket instead of the `host:port`.

For instance an entry such as `/var/tmp/socket-tmp.1` should get
everything to simply work it that was the correct path.
