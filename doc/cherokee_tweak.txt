Cherokee Tweak
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`cherokee-tweak` is a swiss army knife that allows to perform several 
administrative tasks from the command line.
It can connect to a running Cherokee instance, be it in the local computer or 
at a remote location, and request it to perform several actions.

These actions are:
* Log rotation: `logrotate`.
* Live tracing: `trace`.
* Provide information: `info`.

The program accepts the following options:

[grid="rows"]
``~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Parameter,        Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`-h,--help`,      Show usage
`-V, --log`, 	   Show version
`-u, --user`,     Specifies the user name to use for authentication
`-p, --password`, Specifies the password to use fot authentication
`-c, --command`,  One of three commands: `logrotate`, `trace` or `info`
`-a, --url`, 	   URL where the administrative interface can be found
`-l, --log`, 	   Log file to be rotated (use with `-c logrotate`)
`-t, --trace`,    Modules to be traced (use with `-c trace`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use `cherokee-tweak` an administrative interface must be defined within 
Cherokee Admin. That is, you must define a path managed by the handler `Remote 
Administration`. This can be done through the 'Virtual Servers', in 'Behaviour'
and using the 'Add new rule' option.

Please note that while you are at it, the deffinition of a security (through 
the 'Security' tab) is highly encouraged. Although you have the choice to, you 
should never use 'None' as security mechanisim since this would leave your 
system exposed to third parties using `cherokee-tweak`.

Also note that the usage of the `trace` command has no effect unless Cherokee 
is compiled with the --enable-trace. This is a debugging option and it is
unlikely to be present in binary version of Cherokee not specifically compiled
with this in mind.

Every module traceable with CHEROKEE_TRACE can also be traced this way. Refer
to the link:debug.html[Debugging] section of the documentation for more 
information on this matter.
