Cookbook: Setting up Drupal
---------------------------

Setting up link:http://drupal.org/[Drupal] with Cherokee is really
easy. We will assume that our `Document Root` directory is
`/var/www/drupal` of the server we are working on. This recipe uses
Drupal 6.6, which is the latest release at the time of writing.

You will need PHP support correctly configured in Cherokee, and PHP
with the MySQL module installed. The default configuration already
provides a valid PHP configuration for Cherokee if you have php-cgi
installed, but you can follow the appropriate recipe about
link:cookbook_php.html[setting up PHP] in case you don't have it
available for some reason.

Under these conditions, you could start Drupal's installation and you
would already be able to have your site up and running.

However, we can add several refinements to Cherokee's setting. Mainly:

. Forward all requests for www.example.net (or whatever domain is resolved
  to our machine) to example.net

. Set up an appropriate url rewrite configuration for
  Drupal. *WARNING: There is currently an open bug that prevents
  this. This is not yet working, but will be soon.*

. Serve directly as static content some specific file types, avoiding
  any other file requests and eliminating this way any security risk
  related to vulnerable archives.

Setting up Cherokee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default virtual server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We'll begin by cloning the default virtual server, just to keep the
default PHP configuration. Create a clone named `example.net`.

Then, we'll delete every erasable rule in the default virtual server
since we are going to use it to redirect every petition not matched by
the example.net virtual server. We will set the remaining one to be
managed by the `Redirection` handler, like this:

image::media/images/cookbook_drupal_defualt2.png


[grid="rows"]
`~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type     , Regular Expression, Redirection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
External , (.*)$             , http://example.net/$1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After that, this is how the list of rules for this server should look
like.

This clears the first milestone. The remaining three will be
accomplished by tweaking the `example.net` virtual server.


example.net
^^^^^^^^^^^

Remember to set up the `Document root` to `/var/www/drupal`.

Delete all the rules except `php` and `Default`. We're heading right
to the second milestone now.

As previously, we will manage the `Default` rule with the redirection
handler.

`~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type     , Regular Expression, Redirection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Internal , ^/(.*)$           , /index.php?q=$1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember to set up Drupal as custom error handler for the virtual
server. Do so in the `Error Handler` tab, selecting the `Custom
redirections` option and sending 404 errors to Drupal.

[grid="rows"]
`~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~
Error        , URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
404 Not Found, /index.php
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The third milestone, directly serving static files, is an easy task to
accomplish.

Just set up an `Extensions`-type rule for the following extensions:

***************************
jpg,jpeg,gif,css,png,js,ico
***************************

And manage it with the `Static content` handler.

Setting up Drupal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First download and uncompress the distributed Drupal release into
`/var/www/drupal`, and create a database suitable for the installation.

Log in to MySQL:

----------------
mysql -u root -p
----------------

And create the database for Drupal. We will be using the name
'drupal', the user 'drupaluser' and the password 'drupalpassword', but
you should set up your own.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE DATABASE drupal;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal.* TO drupaluser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'drupalpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal.* TO drupaluser@localhost.localdomain IDENTIFIED BY 'drupalpassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then point your web browser to `http://localhost` and follow the
instructions provided by the installer.

You will need to copy the config file and change the permissions manually to proceed:

----
cd /var/www/drupal/sites/default
cp default.settings.php settings.php
chmod 644 settings.php
----

And the installation will be almost automatic. Just fill up the
requested values and you will obtain the following results once your
are through.

WARNING:
Using Clean URLs must be disabled at this stage.
A bug has to be fixed before such an installation works.
Until then the URL rewrites indicated above do not work.
