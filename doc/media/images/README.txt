Since the size of the help screens is fixed to 725px, screenshots
should not exceed it. No image is currently wider than 569px in width,
which the most frequent right now.

Please resize if it is bigger than that. 

Also, maximum recompression is recommended:

optipng -o7 (loosles)
pngnq       (lossy, but it's the one currently used).
