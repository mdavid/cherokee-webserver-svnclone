Cookbook: Setting up Symfony Framework
--------------------------------------
If you need to deploy a Symfony application with Cherokee, the
configuration is trivial. You will find a `Wizard` that can be used
both to deploy the application under a dedicated `Virtual Server` and
under a web folder from one already existent.

[[package_configuration]]
Prepare your Symfony project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The link:http://www.symfony-project.org/[Symfony Framework] is a PHP
framework focused on building more secure, reliable, and modern Web
2.0 applications.

It is essential that Cherokee supports PHP before starting with this
recipe. That should not be a problem since Cherokee-Admin provides a
PHP configuration Wizard. However, you can follow the
link:cookbook_php.html[setting up PHP] recipe for further hints on
fine tuning this feature.

To make sure the recipe works, we'll initialize a simple symfony
application.

This assumes that you already have symfony installed and configured.
You can find information about installation here:
link:http://www.symfony-project.org/installation[Symfony
Installation]. At the time of writing, symfony stable version is 1.2.

Now that you have symfony installed, we shall create a symfony
application in the folder `~/demo`

Open a terminal, and execute the following commands (note that if
symfony is not in your $PATH, you need to prefix 'symfony' with the
actual path to the script):

----
mkdir ~/demo
cd ~/demo
symfony generate:project demo
symfony generate:app demo
symfony generate:module demo demo
----

The above commands will create a symfony project called `demo` inside
the demo folder we just created. Next, it will create an application
called `demo` as well, and then create a module, also called `demo`.

So now that we have the files in place, we'll just create the needed
rules for the web server. Specially important will be the rewrite
rules.


[[wizard_configuration]]
Configure Cherokee using the Wizard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Launch cherokee-admin, and proceed to the
link:config_virtual_servers.html[Virtual servers] section and either
enter the chosen one to install under a web folder, or directly click
on the `Symfony Wizard` to create a customised one.

In either case you will be asked for the basic information and
everything will be handled for you. The two main data pieces will be
the location of the public web folder of your Symfony project (that
is, the part that you wish to make publicly accessible, not the whole
project), and the path to the installed release of Symfony in your
system.

There is nothing else you need to do on Cherokee.

You may need to edit your "hosts" file to include the domain name you
call the virtual server. Your symfony application should then be
accessible. You can find more information about setting up symfony
applications in the symfony manual.

Note that the Wizard configures Cherokee for your project's production
frontend. Should you wish to access the development environment simply
adjust the redirection to the appropriate frontend.


[[manual_configuration]]
Configure Cherokee manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you are wondering, these are manual steps you would have to
follow if you opted for not using the configuration Wizard.

Select or create the virtual server that you will be configuring and
go to the `Behavior` tab to set up the rules.  Remember that the
document root for this virtual server should be the `web` folder in
your demo project.

.Steps
. You will need to keep the rule for the `php` extension. If this rule
  is not present, create it as described in
  link:cookbook_php.html[setting up PHP].

. Next, configure a rule with the handler `File Exists` that should be
  set to a priority lower than that of the `php` rule.  This one can
  be set to match whatever files you like, but the important thing is
  to check the `Match any file` checkbox. Let this rule be handled by
  the link:modules_handlers_file.html[Static Content] handler.

. Afterwards, modify your `Default` rule by configuring the
  link:modules_handlers_redir.html[redirection handler], through the
  `Handler` tab.

[options="header"]
|==========================================
|Type     |Regular Expression |Substitution
|Internal |^.*$               |/index.php
|==========================================

. Symfony includes two controllers. One of them is "index.php". The
  redirection above only makes the "index.php" controller accessible.
  If you are actively developing the web application, you may wish to
  have access to the symfony debug toolbar. In this case, replace
  "/index.php" substitution with "appname_dev.php" where `appname` is
  the name of the symfony application you are setting up. In this
  example, our application name is "demo" so this controller will be
  called "demo_dev.php".

. A slight addition must be added to fix an issue with how requests for
  the root are managed when there is a rule with the `File exists`
  handler in place. If this is not put in place, you will receive 403
  errors. Simply define yet another redirection rule for this regular
  expression:
+
[options="header"]
|=========================================
|Type     |Regular Expression |Redirection
|Internal |^/$                |/index.php
|=========================================

. Finally, you need to set up a rule for the "/sf" directory.
+
[options="header"]
|============================================================================
|Type      |Web Directory |Handler        |Document Root
|Directory |/sf           |Static content |/usr/share/php/data/symfony/web/sf
|============================================================================

Note that the document root for the /sf directory depends on your
installation. The value given above corresponds to a pear installation
of symfony on an Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) system.
