cherokee-config
---------------

This command-line tool is less known than the rest because it is to be
used by system administrators and developers. There is not much to be
added besides the syntax of the command. The main usage of this
utility is determining the used flags during the compilation and
linking process. This is useful to build programs that make use of Cherokee.

This is the full information provided by the manpage.
