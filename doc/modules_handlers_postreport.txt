Handler: Upload Reporting
-------------------------

The 'Upload Progress' plug-in provides feedback to the web browser
about the status of an ongoing POST request.

To make it more convenient, it is implemented so that you don't have
to change a single line of code in your applications. It is compatible
with Lighttpd's mod_uploadprogress, Nginx's
NginxHttpUploadProgressModule, and Apache's equivalent, so chances are
you'll be able to do a seamless migration.

To make use of the plugin you'll need some code on the client
side. Many Javascript snippets and Flash modules are available for
free. The

module has given fairly good results in the past, but there are many
other options available.
