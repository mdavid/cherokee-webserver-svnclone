Development: Debugging Cherokee
-------------------------------

If you need to debug the behavior of the web server (or an
application), there are some helpful tools available for you.

* To start with, if you are using gcc and you want to compile Cherokee
  with debug information just execute make like this:
+
----
  make CFLAGS="-O0 -g3"
----
+
And then you'll be able to execute gdb, cgdb, gdbtui..

* You can use autoconf to set up Cherokee to use static modules:
+
----
  ./autogen.sh --localstatedir=/var --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc  \
  --with-wwwroot=/var/www --enable-static-module=all --enable-static \
  --enable-shared=no
----

* You can also enable a cool feature: the CHEROKEE_TRACE environment
  variable to trace what is going on inside the server. To enable it
  you must add a special flag to your `configure` or `autogen.sh`
  statement:
+
----
  --enable-trace
----
+
This will let you trace the behavior with a human-readable output.
Now, when you are going to launch the web server, just add the
CHEROKEE_TRACE variable, with the desired options:
+
****
cherokee# CHEROKEE_TRACE="common" cherokee

Of course, you can trace all the modules (handlers, loggers..) you need:
+
----
CHEROKEE_TRACE="common,static,io_cache" /usr/bin/cherokee
CHEROKEE_TRACE="all" /usr/bin/cherokee
----
+
By default the environment variable contains a list of comma
separated words, that point the server which parts and actions are
interesting for your trace. Besides, there are a few special cases:
+
  - all: Activates all the trace points
  - time: Prints the time at the beginning of the line
  - thread: Prints the thread ID

* You can also access the functionality of CHEROKE_TRACE through
  `cherokee-tweak`. Refer to the apropriate section of the
  documentation to learn more about this:
  link:bundle_cherokee-tweak.html[cherokee-tweak].


* Lastly a utility is provided, `contrib/tracelor.py`, to provide
  further help to these tracing abilities. It is a little script that
  helps to read the tracing logs by colorizing the thread references
  and highlighting the words passed through the command line.
+
An example of usage would be:
+
----
CHEROKEE_TRACE=thread,all ./cherokee | ../contrib/tracelor.py iocache
----
+
And it would yield an output such as the following. Even if it is
not terribly complicated, it is a handy script to trace the server more
easily.
