Handler: Audio/Video Streaming
------------------------------

This handler is used to stream media files. Both audio and video files
are supported.

The two main features of this module are:

  . `Automatic Traffic Shaping`: All the media file handled by this
    module will be analyzed, so it figures the media bitrate. Once the
    module knows it, it will limit the speed to the bitrate, so server
    bandwidth is not wasted in the case the client stops
    watching/listening the file before it has finished. This feature
    also helps the server to handle a higher user concurrency before
    the bandwidth limit is reached.

  . `Seeking support`: There are some web media players that support
    media seeking by using a ?'start'= parameter. So far, this method
    is supported for FLV files, and it'll be eventually supported for
    H264 videos as well.

If the 'Automatic Traffic Shaping' is enabled, all the media formats
will be streamed, independently on whether or not seeking is supported
for that format.  For instance, even if 'seeking' wouldn't work, any
MP3, OGG, AVI or Matroska file would be streamed according to its
bitrate.

`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Parameters         , Type    , Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``Auto Rate``      , boolean , Whether to enable the bitrate based bandwidth limit.
``Speedup Factor`` , float   , Optional. It's the factor by which the bandwidth \
                               limit would be multiplied. Default: 0.1.
``Initial Boost``  , number  , Optional. Seconds of media that should be sent \
                               before setting the bandwidth limit. This allows the \
						 client to buffer some media. Default: 5 (seconds).

Notes on FLV streaming 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important to remember that FLV videos must be indexed. It is
only possible to seek along the media file if it is has some meta data
tags. Without these tags, seeking just would not work.

There are tools like link:http://inlet-media.de/flvtool2[FLVTool2],
