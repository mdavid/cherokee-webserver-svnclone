<h2>Networking</h2>

<p class="help_p">This sections allows you to configure how the
server interacts with the network.</p>

<p class="help_p"><b>IPv6</b> enables the IPv6 support. If it is
unselected the server will not use IPv6 even if the operating system
supports it.</p>

<p class="help_p"><b>Listen</b>: IP Address to which the server will
bind to wait for incoming requests.</p>

<h2>Basic Behaviour</h2>
<p class="help_p"><b>KeepAlive</b>: enables the global keep alive
support for the client requests. It increases the client performance
by reusing a connection for more than one request. It should most
probably be turn on.</p>

<h2>Server Permissions</h2>
<p class="help_p">If the server is launched with enough privileges,
it is possible to change its effective <b>user</b> and <b>group</b> to
prevent security issues. You can use either the user/group name or its
numerical ID.</p>

<p class="help_p">If a directory is specified as <b>chroot</b>, the
server will jail itself inside it. It is important to know that, even
if chroot is a security mechanism, it should not be used as the only
security measure.</p>
