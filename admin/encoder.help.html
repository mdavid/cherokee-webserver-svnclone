<p>The server encoders are the modules that transform the information
that the server, in one way or the other, generates (reading the hard
drive, relaying on a FastCGI application server, executing a CGI,
etc).</p>

<p>The most important encoders are the compressors. They deflate the
information before it is sent to the client, and therefore speeds up
the request response (there is less information to be sent).</p>

<p>At this time only the most widespread encoder is supported: GZip.
We suggest to use it only with the text base files; trying to encode
images or archives will only increase CPU load for nothing.</p>
