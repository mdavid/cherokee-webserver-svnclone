<h2>System tweaking</h2>

<p class="help_p">This section contains a few options that set
how we want the operating system to treat Cherokee. The most important
option here is the <b>File descriptor number</b>
(<code>fdlimit</code>) limit.<br>
File descriptor number: range values: 128 - 32768, default OS setting
(i.e. 1024, etc.).<br>
It defines how many file descriptors the server can handle.<br>
See also: <code>ulimit -n fdlimit</code> shell command.<br>
Keep in mind that the max. number of concurrent connections
that can be handled is printed by the server at startup and
it is roughly a bit less than (fdlimit / 2).<br>
If the server is very slow in replying to new connections
or if it fails to accept new requests under heavy load,
you may investigate and choose to raise this limit.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: using <code>select</code> or <code>win32</code>
pollers may limit the max. number of file descriptors to a low value
(i.e. only 256 per thread, 256 * 5 = 1280).<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: when setting high fdlimit values (i.e. more than 2048 - 4096 fds)
if on server system is not available or is not used
an efficient fds polling method (i.e. epoll, kqueue, ports),
then it is possible that the server slows down on high number of connections
because of this fact (inefficient polling method).  In this case try
to increase the number of thread (reserving at least 128 fds per thread)
to alleviate the load.

<h2>Server tweaking</h2>

<p class="help_p">The web server can be configured to use some system
call under certain circumstances. Using the <b>Polling method</b> it
is possible to force the server to use a specific file descriptor
polling method even if this is not recommended.</p>

<p class="help_p">The <b>sendfile</b> minimum and maximum limit can he
set to point the server when to use this system call. Depending on the
operating system these limit may vary.<br>
Min. limit: range values: 1 - 2147483647, default: 32768<br>
Max. limit: range values: 1 - 2147483647, default: 2147483647
</p>

<p class="help_p">Finally, the <b>Panic Action</b> option allows you to
define a program that will be called if, by some reason, the server
fails. By default, it should be <em>cherokee-panic</em>.</p>

<h2>Server behaviour</h2>

<p class="help_p">The <b>Reuse Connections</b> field allows to set the
number of how many internal connections per thread should be hold for reuse.
It's an optimization tweaking option.<br>
Reuse connections: range values: 0 - 128, default 20.
</p>

<p class="help_p"><b>Log flush time</b> sets the number of seconds
between log buffer flushes (write to disk).
Setting this number to a value greater than 0 seconds,
usually has a significant positive impact
on performance but this can lead to a loss of log data in case
of an unclean server close or shutdown.<br>
Log flush time: range values: 0 - 60, default 10.
</p>

<p class="help_p">Finally, the <b>Max Keepalive requests</b> allows to
specify the max. number of HTTP requests that can be served by each
keepalive connection. A high number is usually okay.<br>
Max Keepalive requests: range values: 1 - 2147483647, default 500.
