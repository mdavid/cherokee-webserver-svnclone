<h2>System tweaking</h2>

<p class="help_p">This section contains a couple of options that set
how we want the operating system to treat Cherokee. The most important
option here is the <b>File descriptor number</b> limit. It defines how
many file descriptors the server can handle. If the server fails to
reply some requests under heavy loads, this limit needs to be
increased.</p>

<h2>Server tweaking</h2>

<p class="help_p">The web server can be configured to use some system
call under certain circumstances. Using the <b>Polling method</b> it
is possible to force the server to use an specific file description
polling method. It is not recommended though.</p>

<p class="help_p">The <b>sendfile</b> minimum and maximum limit can he
set to point the server when to use this system call. Depending on the
operating system these limit can vary.</p>

<p class="help_p">Finally, the <b>Panic Action</b> option allows to
define a program that will be called if, by some reason, the server
fails. By default, it should be <em>cherokee-panic</em>.</p>

<h2>Server behaviour</h2>

<p class="help_p">The <b>Reuse Connections</b> field allows to set the
number of how many internal connections should be hold for reuse. It's
an optimization tweaking option.</p>

<p class="help_p"><b>Log flush time</b> sets the number of seconds
between log consolidations (flushes). To raise this number usually
have a significant positive impact on performance.</p>

<p class="help_p">Finally, the <b>Max Keepalive requests</b> allows to
specify the number of request that a single connection should reply if
it uses keep-alive. A high number is usually okay.</p>
