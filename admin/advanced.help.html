<h2>System tweaking</h2>

<p class="help_p">This section contains a few options that set
how we want the operating system to treat Cherokee. The most important
option here is the <b>File descriptor number</b>
(<code>max_fds</code>) limit.<br>
File descriptor number: range values: 128 - 32768, default OS setting
(i.e. 1024, etc.).<br>
It defines how many file descriptors the server can handle.<br>
See also: <code>ulimit -n max_fds</code> shell command.<br>
Keep in mind that the max. number of concurrent connections
that can be handled is printed by the server at startup and
it is roughly a bit less than (max_fds / 2).<br>
If the server is very slow in replying to new connections
or if it fails to accept new requests under heavy load,
you may investigate and choose to raise this limit.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: using <code>select</code> or <code>win32</code>
pollers may limit the max. number of file descriptors to a low value
(i.e. only 256 per thread, 256 * 5 = 1280).
</p>

<h2>Server tweaking</h2>

<p class="help_p">The web server can be configured to use some system
call under certain circumstances. Using the <b>Polling method</b> it
is possible to force the server to use a specific file descriptor
polling method. It is not recommended though.</p>

<p class="help_p">The <b>sendfile</b> minimum and maximum limit can he
set to point the server when to use this system call. Depending on the
operating system these limit may vary.<br>
Min. limit: range values: 1 - 2147483647, default: 32768<br>
Max. limit: range values: 1 - 2147483647, default: 2147483647
</p>

<p class="help_p">Finally, the <b>Panic Action</b> option allows you to
define a program that will be called if, by some reason, the server
fails. By default, it should be <em>cherokee-panic</em>.</p>

<h2>Server behaviour</h2>

<p class="help_p">The <b>Reuse Connections</b> field allows to set the
number of how many internal connections should be hold for reuse. It's
an optimization tweaking option.<br>
Reuse connections: range values: 0 - 128, default 20.
</p>

<p class="help_p"><b>Log flush time</b> sets the number of seconds
between log consolidations (flushes).
Setting this number to a value greater than 1 - 2 seconds,
usually has a significant positive impact
on performance but this can lead to a loss of log data in case
of an unclean server close or shutdown.<br>
Log flush time: range values: 0 - 60, default 10.
</p>

<p class="help_p">Finally, the <b>Max Keepalive requests</b> allows to
specify the max. number of HTTP requests that can be served by each
keepalive connection. A high number is usually okay.<br>
Max Keepalive requests: range values: 1 - 2147483647, default 500.
