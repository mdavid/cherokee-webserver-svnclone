<h2>Virtual Server List</h2>

<p class="help_p">Here you can manage the virtual server list.</p>

<p class="help_p">There must be at least one virtual server
named <b>default</b>. It is important to know that this server cannot
be deleted.</p>

<p class="help_p">When the server receives a request it will try to
match the virtual server that should handle it. In case no virtual
server matches the request, <i>default</i> will be used.</p>

<h2>Add new Virtual Server</h2>

<p class="help_p">You have to enter the server name and a
valid <b>Document Root</b> directory in order to create a new virtual
server.  Once those fields are filled out, a new configuration page
will allow to configure the virtual server details.</p>

<p class="help_p"><b>Name</b> is an alias. The domain names handled
by the virtual server should be specified later in the virtual server
details page.</p>
