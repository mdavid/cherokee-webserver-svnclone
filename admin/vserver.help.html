<h2>Basics</h2>
 <p class="help_p">The <b>Document Root</b> must point to the
 directory that holds the web; <b>Directory Indexes</b> can specify a
 list of files that act as special index files, for
 instance: <em>index.html,index.php</em>.</p>

<h2>Domain names</h2>
 <p class="help_p">A simple virtual server can handle an unlimited
 number of domain names. In fact, it is even able to configure a
 virtual server to handle all the domains that match with a list of
 custom wildcats. For example: </p>

 <pre class="help_p">www.alobbs.com</pre>
 <pre class="help_p"> *.example.com</pre><br>

 <p class="help_p">If the domain name list is empty, the domain
 alias will be used internally as its only entry.</p>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
 <p class="help_p">This is the most important part of the virtual
 server configuration. This section sets the rules about how the
 virtual server will reply to the client requests.</p>

 <p class="help_p">When a request is going to be replied by a
 virtual server, it needs to make a decision on what it should do. For
 instance, whether it ought to execute a CGI, read a static file or
 relay the request on an application server. That decision will be
 based on the rules defined by this list.</p>

 <p class="help_p">The virtual server will try to match the request
 will all the rules from <b>highest to lowest</b> priority until an
 entry matches.</p>
 
<h2>Error Handler</h2>
 <p class="help_p">It is possible to customize how the server reports
 errors. Depending on the error handler it will generate different
 error responses.</p>

 <p class="help_p">The default handler replies as you expect a server
 to reply, so most probably you will not need to change it.</p>

 <p class="help_p">However, there is another error handler that allows
 you to set a custom redirection for each different error code; in
 that way you can show your own error messages.</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>
 <p class="help_p">By default the virtual server does not log the
 server transactions, nor the error messages. In this section you have
 to specify the format that the server should use when writing
 accesses and errors and where it should store them.</p>

 <p class="help_p">The most popular choice is <b>Apache Compatible</b>
 format using a single file for the access log and the error
 log.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
 <p class="help_p">This section allows you to configure the required
 files to enable the <b>TLS</b>/<b>SSL</b> support for a certain
 virtual server.</p>

 <p class="help_p">A <b>Certificate</b>, <b>Certificate key</b>
 and <b>CA List</b> files are needed in order to allow the server to
 activate the secure connections (<b>https</b>) engine.</p>
