## cherokee.conf -- Cherokee HTTP server configuration file
##

##
## Port: The port to which the standalone server listens. For
## ports < 1023, you will need cherokee to be run as root initially.
## Security: if you do start the server as root, be sure not to set
## "User" to root. 
##
Port 80

##
## TLS Port:
##
## To start TLS/SSL, please be sure to generate your SSL keys (read
## dos/How_to_generate_SSL_keys.html). Once this is done, enable the
## service by enabling the SSL module:
##
## # ln -s /etc/cherokee/mods-available/ssl /etc/cherokee/mods-enabled/ssl/
##
# PortTLS 443

##
## IPv6 support
##
IPv6 Off

##
## This directiveis used to tell the server which IP address to listen to.
##
#Listen 127.0.0.1

##
## If you wish cherokee to run as a different user or group, you must run
## cherokee as root initially and it will switch.
##
## Eg: User www-data
##     Group www-data
##
## Eg: User 65534
##     Group 65534
##
#User nobody
#Group nogroup

##
## Chroot:
##
# Chroot %wwwroot%

##
## Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
##
Timeout 60

##
## KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
## one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
##
KeepAlive On

##
## MaxKeepAliveRequests: The MaxKeepAliveRequests directive limits the 
## number of requests allowed per connection when KeepAlive is on.
## We recommend that this setting be kept to a high value for maximum 
## server performance.
##
MaxKeepAliveRequests 500

##
## ServerTokens:  This directive configures what you return as the Server 
## HTTP response Header. The default is 'Full' which sends information about
## the OS-Type and compiled in modules.  Full conveys the most information, 
## and Product the least.

## Product  -  Cherokee
## Minor    -  Cherokee/0.0
## Minimal  -  Cherokee/0.0.0
## OS       -  Cherokee/0.0.0 (UNIX)
