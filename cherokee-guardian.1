.SH NAME
cherokee-guardian \- Cherokee web server safe invoker
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cherokee\-guardian
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcherokee\fP is an extremely fast, flexible and embedable web
server.  \fBcherokee\-guardian\fP is the recommended way to invoke
cherokee - It will launch Cherokee with any options specified to it
via the command line, and monitor it. In case Cherokee ends
abnormally, it will be immediately re-launched.
.PP
In future versions, cherokee\-guardian will probably become the main
binary to invoke Cherokee.
.SH BUGS
.SS Bug reports
I would appreciate hearing of any problems you have with Cherokee.  I
would also like to hear from you if you have successfully used Cherokee,
especially if you are using it for a distribution.
.PP
There is a mailing list for discussion among Cherokee users and for
announcements of new and test versions. To join, send a message to
cherokee-admin@cherokee-project.com with the line:
.PP
.B subscribe cherokee
.PP
in the body of the message. The submission address is cherokee@cherokee-project.com.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
For information on the options with which Cherokee itself accepts,
please refer to  \&\fIcherokee\fR\|(1)
.
Note that in in Debian systems, a startup/shutdown script
/etc/init.d/cherokee is provided, and will probably be the most
convenient invocation method.
